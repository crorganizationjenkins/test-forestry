<p>Want to know exactly how to reach the appropriate customer service tech at Verizon? Just look them up on this handy list of <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/comment/552/53704">every number they have</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, a contractor or some such swiped the list and put it out into the world for the benefit of every Verizon customer who had to wade through the morass of voice prompts just to find someone to talk to. Good on him or her.</p>
<p>We're putting a copy of the list after the jump, for posterity and archive's sake. If you have access to a major company's customer service and support directory&mdash;we're not interested in contacting the office of the president <i>yet</i>&mdash;pass it along. (<i>Thanks, Thomas!</i>)</p>
<p><i>Update: Here's another great link, with much of the <a href="http://pcsintel.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=10#cingular">customer service numbers for the other carriers</a>. (Thanks, Danilo!)</i></p>
