<p>Mega-churches have been slowly coalescing since at least the '70s (and have a historical thread in the evangelical tent revival of the 1800s), but recent experiments in super-sizing the Body of Christ have taken things to a new level in large. See, for instance, <a href="http://lakewood.cc">Lakewood Church</a>, who recently completed a $90+ million renovation on the Compaq Center, former home of the Houston Rockets.</p>
<p>To their credit, Lakewood does not solicit money on their weekly over-the-air broadcasts. Apparently, the 30,000 or more weekly attendees generate enough money to keep the Southern Baptist offshoot alive and amplified. With a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston#Demographics">per capita income</a> in Houston of $20,101 and the traditional 10% yearly tithe, Lakewood Church should be bringing in over sixty million dollars a year.</p>
<p>Let's get ready to hummmble!</p>
