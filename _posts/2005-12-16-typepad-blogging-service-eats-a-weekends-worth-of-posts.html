excerpt: We were going to follow up post about something we wrote about a few days
  ago, but it would have involved linking to a Typepad blog. Too bad for us, then,
  because Typepad is seriously bloopsed at the moment. Not only is service not working—and
  hasn't been for at least eight hours, we've been told—but posts made since Friday
  have been eaten by the system.

<p>We were going to follow up post about something we wrote about a few days ago, but it would have involved linking to a Typepad blog. Too bad for us, then, because <a href="http://status.sixapart.com/">Typepad is seriously bloopsed</a> at the moment. Not only is service not working&mdash;and hasn't been for at least eight hours, we've been told&mdash;but posts made since Friday have been eaten by the system.</p>
<p>Downtime is quite bad. Losing bloggers' posts is a crime against writing, like bloggers' posts.</p>
