excerpt: "• If you are actually going to buy an MP3 player that isn't an iPod, Best
  Buy has a promotion that gives you a free $50 gift card with the purchase—excluding
  iPods. The Sandisk Sansa 512MB player is just $100, for instance."

<p>&bull; If you are actually going to buy an MP3 player that isn't an iPod, <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?type=category&id=pcmcat78700050016">Best Buy has a promotion</a> that gives you a free $50 gift card with the purchase&mdash;excluding iPods. The Sandisk Sansa 512MB player is just $100, for instance.</p>
<p>&bull; Or! Ditch the gift card and get twice the capacity in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00099I1F8/ref=nosim/002-2776641-2416065?n=172282">Creative Zen Nano 1GB</a> MP3 player at Amazon. It's $109, which isn't bad on its own, but also has a $10 MIR.</p>
<p>&bull; Or even! Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot</a>, the Virgin Electronics 5GB MP3 player with FM Tuner and speakers for $125, shipped. These were pulled from the shelves nearly as soon as they arrived, but they really aren't a bad deal. We say go for it.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.circuitcity.com/ccd/specialBrowse.do?context=outlet&catOid=-14001&c=1&cm_re=main%20marquee-_-Web-only:%20save%20up%20to%2060%25%20instantly%20on%20select%20gifts%20and%20gadgets-_-All%20outlet%20gadgets">CircuitCity</a> has lots of little gadgets from NexxTech in deep discount, most of which would make passable stocking stuffers. Especially the Blue Bug Massager. [via <a href="http://dealnews.com">DealNews</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; If there is one pointless purchase we have resisted so far this year, it would be the Back to Basics TEM500 Egg & Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher aka The Egg McMuffin Machine. Amazon has it on sale for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B18P96/002-2776641-2416065?n=284507">$40, shipped</a>.</p>
