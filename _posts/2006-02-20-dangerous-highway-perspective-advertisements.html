This looks a bit photoshopped, but assuming it isn't, it's pretty dang cool. Of course, we're not entirely sure about whether a three-dimensional perspective painting is really good advertising, especially on the highway, where one has enough to worry about without trying to dodge imaginary fifty foot long horizontal beer bottles rolling out of the back of eighteen-wheeler trucks.</p>
<p>And do they even work? Sure, it's swell if you happen to be driving at exactly the same speed as the truck, on the left side, hovering behind at exactly the distance required to make the illusion work. But otherwise, all you see is a long distracting smear that causes you to veer wildly into oncoming traffic.</p>
