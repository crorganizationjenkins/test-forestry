excerpt: "â€¢ Top Secret Threadless Sale! Buy 3 or more tees, get them all for $10 each.
  (Thanks, Garret!)"

<p>&bull; Top Secret Threadless Sale! <a href="http://www.jakenickell.com/entry/1114">Buy 3 or more tees, get them all for $10 each</a>. (<i>Thanks, Garret!</i>)</p>
<p>&bull; Flash memory prices are crashing. Adorama has a 2GB SanDisk CompactFlash card for $110 plus shipping. Slickdeals has a <a href="http://slickdeals.net/#p7041">handy listing</a>. We wish we would have waited to buy our camera's second CF card a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>&bull; Import shop <a href="http://us.yesasia.com/en/PrdDept.aspx/code-j/section-games/version-all/did-5/pid-1004115193/">YesAsia.com</a> is taking preorders for the upcoming Nintendo DS Lite handheld game system. They want $200, though, and the system is probably going to retail in the US for $150 in just a couple months more, so unless you really must have a smaller-shelled DS...</p>
<p>Oh, our friendly neighborhood gamers at Kotaku are running a <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/contest/the-ds-lite-contest-153124.php">trivia scavenger hunt</a> to give away a DS. Fair warning&mdash;it's not going to be easy if you're not a gamer.</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon and others are now selling the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ZAIM8/102-0392434-9450502?n=172282">1GB iPod Shuffle</a> for a hundred bucks. That's not a deal, per se, because Apple released a new <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/portable-media/1gb-nano-for-150-153184.php">1GB iPod nano</a> for $150. Is the screen worth the extra scratch? Yeah, we think it probably is.</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon is also selling the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_nr_p_3_0/102-0392434-9450502?%5Fencoding=UTF8&keywords=Wamsutta%20100%25%20Cotton%20Gingham%20Flannel&rh=i%3Akitchen-aps%2Ck%3AWamsutta%20100%25%20Cotton%20Gingham%20Flannel%2Cp%5F3%3A%240-%2424&page=1">Wamsutta 100% Cotton Gingham Flannel Bedding</a> starting from $9 (but bigger items, like duvet covers, are around $50). Still, that's half off.</p>
