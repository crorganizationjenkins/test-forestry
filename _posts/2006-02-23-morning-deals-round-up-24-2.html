excerpt: "â€¢ Pick up one of two Motorola Bluetooth headsets on the cheap: the HS805
  for $25 or the MS815 for $30. Use the coupon code RAZRREWARDS for an additional
  10% off. These should work fine with non-Motorola but Bluetooth-equipped phones."

<p>&bull; Pick up one of two Motorola Bluetooth headsets on the cheap: the <a href="http://motorola.digitalriver.com/DRHM/servlet/ControllerServlet?Action=DisplayProductDetailsPage&SiteID=motostor&Locale=en_US&Env=BASE&productID=36081600">HS805 for $25</a> or the <a href="http://motorola.digitalriver.com/DRHM/servlet/ControllerServlet?Action=DisplayProductDetailsPage&SiteID=motostor&Locale=en_US&Env=BASE&productID=38795400">MS815 for $30</a>. Use the coupon code <b>RAZRREWARDS</b> for an additional 10% off. These should work fine with non-Motorola but Bluetooth-equipped phones.</p>
<p>&bull; Here's an anachronistic flashback to an earlier age of gadgets: The <a href="http://www.surpluscomputers.com/store/main.aspx?p=ItemDetail&item=CES11086">Naxa 2.5-inch LCD Portable Color TV</a> is on sale for just $74 from Surplus Computers. With a telescoping antenna and everything. When we were a child, a similar Sony model was a prized possession, and we would gloatingly share it with other kids on the bus for every second of its 20 minute battery life.</p>
<p>&bull; We hardly need another radio-based communication device, but these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000246X28/102-0392434-9450502?n=172282">XACT Communication M2X-2 X-Linx Personal FRS/GMRS 2-Way Communicators</a> look pretty snazzy for $33, with their built-in carabiners and everything. Technically you need a special license from the FCC to operate in the GMRS bands, but if you don't tell, we won't either. [via <a href="http://dealnews.com">DealNews</a>]</p>
