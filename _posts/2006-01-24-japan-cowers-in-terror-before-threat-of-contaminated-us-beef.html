<p>On one hand, congratulations to Atlantic Veal & Lamb for shipping contaminated cow bones to Japan within two weeks of the ban on US beef being lifted. That<br />
s the sort of fuck-up that can only be met with a golf clap.</p>
<p>On the other<br />
 Hello, Japan? Guess what? It isn't very likely eating the brain of even the funkiest and craziest bovine is going to croak you. Don't get us wrong - we can understand our Northern Neighbors getting excitable. A logical appraisal of chance is irrelevant to the residents of, say, Moose Knuckle, Saskatchewan&mdash;they need to ensure the purity of their beef jerky stocks, which accounts for 67% of Canada<br />
s GDP. But shouldn<br />
t the Japanese&mdash;who are so into science that they send their <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3170061.stm">walking, talking robots to meet with foreign dignitaries</a>&mdashlunderstand the difference between typical media hysteria and actual scientific threat? Because the chance of getting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is <em>one in ten billion.</em></p>
<p>Imagine for a second that America banned the import of Japanese television sets the second they found out that <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8663630273311292125&q=ringu">Sadako had climbed out of one and started killing people.</a> Then you<br />
ll understand the absurdity of the actual threat versus Japan<br />
s overblown hyper-reaction.</p>
