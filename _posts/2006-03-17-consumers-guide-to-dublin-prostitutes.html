<p>In honor of St. Patty's day, we present our Gawker bro Gridskipper's guide to getting your wick dipped in Dublin. [NSFW links]</p>
<p>Quoth: "It is relatively safe and easy to arrange an affordable and enjoyable sexual encounter in Dublin if you are willing to do a little research before you arrive."</p>
<p>We advise that the safest and most affordable way, though not necessarily the easiest, to arrange a sexual encounter is to meet somebody you like and get to know them better. But we digress. Back to the hookers, after the jump...</p>
<p>TIPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrange an appointment before you arrive.
</li>
<li>Prospects include the independent ladies of <a href="http://www.irishescorts.com/independent_escorts/independents.php">Irish Escorts</a> (such as <a href="http://www.irishescorts.com/svetlana/">Svetlana</a> above) or the Dublin section of <a href="http://www.irishindependentescorts.com/escorts_dublin.php">Irish Independent Escorts</a>. And <a href="http://www.escortsireland.net/">Escorts Ireland</a> is a specialized message board that should help you gather any information or advice you might need. 
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sexindublin.com/">Sex in Dublin</a> gives details of the Dublin streetwalking scene, as well as some details about the various laws dealing with prostitution in Ireland.
</li>
<li>Check your date's online reviews to see if the woman you are interested in has been positively reviewed by other visitors.
</li>
<li>Instead of taking the girl back to your hotel room, as over-enthusiastic night managers may go to extreme lengths to scuttle your plans, arrange an in-call appointment at the girl's apartment. <br />
If you do bring her back to your room, it's helpful to arrive before 10pm and if your paid companion is visually presentable as a<br />
girlfriend<br />
 rather than as a contestant in a <em>Rocky Horror</em> costume competition.
</li>
<li>Alternatively, the upscale club scene is represented by <a href="http://www.stringfellows.ie/">Stringfellows </a> in Parnell Street, about 200 meters from O<br />
Connell Street.</li>
</ul>
