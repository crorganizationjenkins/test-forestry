excerpt: "â€¢ It would appear the Dell coupons for the Canon 20D Digital SLR Camera
  are already kaput, but there's still time to sneak in a 20% coupon for the Digital
  Rebel XT Silver Body. Add coupon code: TDZ2BZCXTN?PMX, add in another discount from
  The Dell Game, and use the $75 Rebate for a total of $600. Not shabby at all for
  a great camera, although you'll still want to purchase a lens. [via Slickdeals]"

<p>&bull; It would appear the Dell coupons for the Canon 20D Digital SLR Camera are already kaput, but there's still time to sneak in a 20% coupon for the Digital Rebel XT Silver Body. Add coupon code: <b>TDZ2BZCXTN?PMX</b>, add in another discount from <a href="http://dell.eprize.net/regifting">The Dell Game</a>, and use the <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/app/pdf/Promotions/CIWC_101505_ClaimForm.pdf">$75 Rebate</a> for a total of $600. Not shabby at all for a great camera, although you'll still want to purchase a lens. [via <a href="http://slickdeals.net">Slickdeals</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Are you ready to buy a crap phone from a tossy service provider just because it's flat, metal, and trendy? We figured you were. Try the newest version of the Motorola Razr V3c from <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/affiliate?vendorid=BEFREE&jspName=/splash/store.jsp&cm_ven=CJ&cm_pla=39022613&cm_ite=trackforq102nso-b">Verizon</a>, now with support for high-speed cellular data access. $200 after a $100 rebate&mdash;and a contract. [via <a href="http://techbargains.com">TechBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.woot.com/">Woot's</a> deal of the day is a tough one to call: a Compaq X Athlon 64 Gaming System for $700. The components actually all are fairly quality, but for a gaming system, the video card is nearly two generations behind. We say give it a pass.</p>
