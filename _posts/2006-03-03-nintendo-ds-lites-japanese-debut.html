excerpt: Everyone who got burned on the original Nintendo Gameboy Advance debacle
  felt the existential yawning of deja vu when Nintendo recently announced that, less
  than a year after launch, they were shrinking down the size of their Nintendo DS
  handheld and making the screen better. This was after previously ensuring all of
  us that the device was Panglossian in its perfection and could not be foreseeably
  improved. What a perfect way to burn the customers who made Nintendo's experimental
  console a success â€” try to sell them the same product again a year later with the
  form factor that the product could have been in the first place!

<p>Everyone who got burned on the original Nintendo Gameboy Advance debacle felt the existential yawning of deja vu when Nintendo recently announced that, less than a year after launch, they were shrinking down the size of their Nintendo DS handheld and making the screen better. This was after previously ensuring all of us that the device was Panglossian in its perfection and could not be foreseeably improved. What a perfect way to burn the customers who made Nintendo's experimental console a success &mdash; try to sell them the same product again a year later with the form factor that the product could have been in the first place!</p>
<p>So this news report, straight from Japan, of the Nintendo DS Lite's debut is our way of putting sweet little kisses on the gaping wound of our disemboweled wallet.</p>
