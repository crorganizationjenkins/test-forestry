excerpt: â€¢ ThinkGeek really has more fun stuff than they should, although for every
  'Tool Logic Office Companion' there's a 'STFU University Tee.' Should you need to
  stuff a stocking, nothing says 'You are pathetic but I will still copulate with
  you," like O'Reilly Pillowcases.

<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/548166/102-0392434-9450502">Amazon's Friday Sale!</a> There are a hundred-and-fifty items on sale today (the last day Free Super Saver Shipping will get there by Christmas), but the clear highlight is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00068O5C0/ref=br_lf_outlet_22/102-0392434-9450502?n=548166&s=outlet&v=glance">Wallace Yellow Ribbon Support Our Troops Ball</a>. Do the Iraqi hustle!</p>
<p>&bull; Ritz Camera has the totally quality <a href="http://www.ritzcamera.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=13342705&storeId=10001&langId=-1&catalogId=10001">Nikon D50 Digital DSLR with Nikkor 28-80mm Kit Lens</a> for $650, bundled with a $50 gift coupon, an Epson Photo Printer, and a 19-inch stuff bear. We're a Canon family around here, but there ain't a thing wrong with the D50 if you're looking for an entry-level DSLR. [via <a href="http://techbargains.com">TechBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon is selling the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002WPSBC/102-0392434-9450502?n=172282">Logitech Z-5500 Digital 5.1 5-Piece Speaker System with Subwoofer</a> for $220 shipped. We paid about $80 more than that in March and you know what? We still don't regret the purchase as much as our upstairs neighbors do. Suck down that funky bluegrass, hipsters. (If we were nice, we'd have picked up these <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?URL=http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp%3fskuId=7334627&type=product&id=1118845328567">Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones</a> for $20, instead.)</p>
<p>&bull; Best Buy has <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?URL=http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp%3fskuId=7334627&type=product&id=1118845328567">Call of Duty 2</a> for PC for just $35 with cheap shipping. If you're still into WWII shooters, it's supposed to be quality. [via <a href="http://dealnews.com">Dealnews</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a> The Creative Soundblaster Audigy 2 Platinum eX Sound Card with the fancy-ass external input/output breakout box, for $115 shipped. For almost everyone, the sound card you already have in your computer is going to be <i>just fine</i>. For gamers or budding musicians, well... There are probably better options, honestly, but that's a solid price. We say go for it&mdash;you can always use another remote control from your PC.</p>
