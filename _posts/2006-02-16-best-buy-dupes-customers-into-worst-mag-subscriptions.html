<p>In a classic bait-and-switch, customers allege that Best Buy tells people they get a free magazine subscription and then charges them for it. </p>
<p>
Don<br />
t worry, it<br />
s absolutely free. We<br />
re doing a special promotion<br />
 a Best Buy cashier allegedly told Chelsea Tulin at checkout. </p>
<p>After getting home, she checked receipt and saw at the bottom Best Buy had given her credit/debit info to Time. They also gave Time permission to charge her card after the 8 issue free trial for 24 issues at 24.95 and to auto charge renewals every 6 months afterwards.</p>
<p>On Time<br />
s website you can get 84 issues for $29.95</p>
<p>Dawn Bryant, a Best Buy spokesperson, told the SF Gate that,<br />
the reasoning behind this promotion is for us to give customers things they can appreciate. It<br />
s to best serve the customer.</p>
<p>Tell that to the attorney generals of Wisconssin, Ohio and New Jersey, who all filed suits against Best Buy for deceptive practices.</p>
<p>Chelsea canceled her subscription once she saw what was happening. "It shouldn't be up to consumers to have to stay on top of these things," she said, "But it is."</p>
