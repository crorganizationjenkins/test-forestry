<p>Here's a spam we keep getting for some reason, despite the fact that the sender, Gary Coxe, isn't going to trick us into hiring him for a weekly column about how to struggle against adversity (or whatever it is he expects to get out of emailing a <i>shopping</i> site). Here's his classy message, today sent with the headline, "Frey's book allegedly a scam!?  Want to do a story on a TRUE tragedy story?"<br />
<blockquote>
<p> His wife told him his baby wasn't his, [<i>Gosh, why ever would she do that? -Ed.</i>]</p>
<p> His father was murdered,</p>
<p> His Uncle was killed in a plane crash,</p>
<p> Grandfather and stepfather died of cancer,</p>
<p> Lost a hundred thousand dollar a year business as a teenager,</p>
<p> Had $30,000 cash in the bank and lost it all,</p>
<p> All this and much more happened to Gary in about 4 years _ all by the time he was 21 years old.<br />
But he has bounced back now!<br />
So, today Gary owns several businesses and pilots his own private airplane and helicopter<br />
- he truly walks his talk.</p></blockquote>
