<p><img alt="hamburgerjpg.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hamburgerjpg.jpg" width="150" height="135" class="right-img" />Looking for more information on the Shamrock Shake, we happened to come across the above subtle bit of informational vandalism over at the Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s_menu_items">McDonald's Menu Items</a>. Click the image for a larger view. </p>
<p>In addition to the cheeseburger and hamburger description, we suspect that the image of a McDonald's cheeseburger just <em>has</em> to be a plant. No one who wasn't trying to prove a point would upload an image of something so unpalatable. Yet apparently it's completely legit.</p>
