<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=1549583">Man, you Jews out there can't eat <em>anything</em> safely, can you?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>"Beetlejuice" is more than just a movie name<br />
 foodmakers regularly use crushed female cochineal beetles to dye food, particularly certain yogurts, juices and candy, The Wall Street Journal reported today.</p>
<p>While shocking, it's perfectly legal, the paper reports. Foodmakers don't have to list the bug-based ingredient, because beetles are part of nature. Only man-made dyes, like FD&C Red No. 40, have to be listed.</p>
<p>But that may change soon. The Food and Drug Administration may recommend that companies list beetle additives as "carmine" or "cochineal."</p>
<p>Why? Using beetles in food proves problematic for vegetarians, people who keep kosher and for those with certain food allergies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that this new FDA regulation makes no mention of the full disclosure of <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/fast-food/family-eats-roach-sandwiches-at-kfc-150677.php">baby insects inside your Kentucky Fried Roachwich</a>, so the othodox, Hessidic o.g. ois in our audience may want to consult their punk rock rabbis.</p>
