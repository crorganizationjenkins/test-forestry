excerpt: When once we were Tiny Consumerists who ate dirt, our sniffling noses and
  mild fevers were accompanied by dread. Would we be subjected to that foul syrup
  Nyquil, the vile tincture that tasted like candied anise melted between the assfolds
  of Sammy Davis Jr's scotch-soaked corpse? Even with a milk chaser and the (inexplicably
  effective) soothing sound of a running tap, we could barely choke it back. This
  quickly bred our propensity for bucking up, which will be useful come the day when
  we are dying of lung cancer and Gawker Media still doesn't offer insurance.

<p>When once we were Tiny Consumerists who ate dirt, our sniffling noses and mild fevers were accompanied by dread. Would we be subjected to that foul syrup Nyquil, the vile tincture that tasted like candied anise melted between the assfolds of Sammy Davis Jr's scotch-soaked corpse? Even with a milk chaser and the (inexplicably effective) soothing sound of a running tap, we could barely choke it back. This quickly bred our propensity for <i>bucking up</i>, which will be useful come the day when we are dying of lung cancer and Gawker Media still doesn't offer insurance.</p>
<p>Even Nyquil LiquiCaps, ostensibly devoid of the funk, have barely allowed us to use the medicine over the years, but now we have an even better excuse for avoiding the stuff: apparently it <a href="http://superrob.blogspot.com/2005/11/new-dayquil-and-nyquil-blows-lot.html">now blows</a>. Blogger Rob Stevens blames the ineffectiveness of NyQuil and DayQuil on a recent change of ingredients. Nyquil has ditched the decongestant pseudoephedrine in favor of phenylephrine and doxylamine succinate. Neither apparently works as effectively as the pseudoephedrine, either on a sick person's nose, or in the crusty coffee machine carafe of the apocryphal neighborhood meth cooker.</p>
<p>Fortunately, not all over-the-counter pharms are so afraid of the demon methamphetamines: Advil Cold & Sinus as well as Tylenol Cold & Flu still kick out the sinus jams, mufferfuffer.</p>
