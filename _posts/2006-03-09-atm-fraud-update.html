<p>Ok, so hackers snagged possibly up to six figures of people's debit card info from an unspecified retailer's security breach. But who? WHO is the retailer stupid enough to let this happen?</p>
<p>One name that keeps getting bandied about is... Office Max.</p>
<p>Check what the Raleigh, NC New & Observer <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/104/story/416162.html">has to say</a>:
<ul>"Bank officials and federal investigators will not disclose the retailer or retailers thought to be at the center of the data breach because the investigation continues.</ul></p>
<p>Local customers said OfficeMax is the name given by their financial institutions when asked for details. Many of the transactions appear to have been made in February, though investigators won't define the period."</p>
<p>See, that wasn't so hard. All we have to do is go to Staples.</p>
<p>This is actually really good news. Now we can easily dub the fiasco, "Off!c3 H@x0r."</p>
