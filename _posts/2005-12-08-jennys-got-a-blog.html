excerpt: Nestled inside MSN Spaces like a leaking hideaway bed, Jennifer Convertibles
  has a blog. And what a blog it is, filled with the joyous outpourings of happy customers,
  each of whom could only have been happier with their selection if the couch had
  itself hacked apart their interred loved ones with an axe.

<p>Nestled inside MSN Spaces like a leaking hideaway bed, Jennifer Convertibles has a blog. And what a blog it is, filled with the joyous outpourings of happy customers, each of whom could only have been happier with their selection if the couch had itself hacked apart their interred loved ones with an axe.</p>
<p>And if we use the frequency of posts as a metric, Jennifer Convertibles gets one-to-two satisfied customers <i>every month</i>. Too bad all the really cool furniture stores have moved on to myspace. (<i>Thanks, Bucky!</i>)</p>
