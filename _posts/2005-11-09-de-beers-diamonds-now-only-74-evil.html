excerpt: South African diamond cartel De Beers has announced that it will be transferring
  a 26% share of its mining operation, De Beers Consolidated Mines, into a holding
  company that is half-owned by De Beers employees and pensioners. (Which we suppose
  could be mathed out to mean they are still 85% evil, depending on who owns the other
  half of the holding company.)

<p>A step in the right direction, but diamonds are still tacky. That is until, of course, this whole <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/diamond.html">synthetic diamond thing</a> works out. Then The Consumerist will be decked in nigh-on indescrutible layers of glittering ice.</p>
