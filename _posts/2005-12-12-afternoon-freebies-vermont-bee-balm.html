<p>&bull; <a href="http://dell.eprize.net/regifting/">Dell Game!</a> Dell Game! Choose the middle stocking and win nothing, again and again!</p>
<p>&bull; <i>Redbook</i> readers (and by proxy, <i>Consumerist</i> readers) can <a href="http://www.chickenofthesea.com/redbook/promo.html">sign up to receive a sample</a> of Chicken of the Sea's upcoming salmon and ahi tuna steaks when they become available this spring. They say only the first 1,000 sign-ups are eligible, so if we don't get a vacuum-sealed slab of fish flesh in the mail by April, we're going right back to dolphin.</p>
<p>&bull; Speaking of dolphins, get a free sample of Wardley's <a href="http://hartz.msh0.com/adhoc/20051202/sign_up.html">Spectra Max tropical fish food</a>. Dolphins can't eat this stuff, but when you've got one locked up in the bedroom, it sure is hilarious to watch them try.</p>
<p>&bull; For a free sample of Original Bee Balm ointment for hands, body, and lips, send a stamped, self-addressed envelope to: Vermont Bee Balm Company 1181 Guy Lot Road Craftsbury, Vermont 05826. They're a <a href="http://vermontbeebalm.com/co.htm">small, family-run company</a>, so maybe send them something nice in return. (Not bees.)</p>
