<p>It all depends on what your definition of, "is a receipt," is.</p>
<p>M.B. sends us Ms. Young's detailed report on Circuit City not honoring its advertised rebates. She ordered a cable modem online with a $40 advertised rebate.</p>
<p>Two months later she got a letter saying her rebate was denied because it was an "Invalid Purchase Location," a caveat that she and Circuit City agree was not disclosed anywhere.</p>
<p>But that was only the beginning, as she learned after a succession of calls to Circuit City where the customer service reps actually hung up on her mid-call. </p>
<p>"It appears that this practice of rejecting otherwise valid rebate submissions continues to date, and that Circuit City is fulling aware and complacent in the practice. I claim that this problem is systemic, and that Circuit City is intentionally practicing deceptive marketing," writes Ms. Young.</p>
