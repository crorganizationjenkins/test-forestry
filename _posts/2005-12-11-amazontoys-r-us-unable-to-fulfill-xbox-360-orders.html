<p>The Xbox 360 shortage is getting extremely out of hand. According to <a href="http://www.worthplaying.com/article.php?sid=30472&mode=thread&order=0">this post</a> at gaming web site WorthPlaying, Amazon is canceling orders for the impossible-to-find console.<br />
<blockquote>Though we had expected to be able to send this item to you, we've since found that it is not available from any of our sources at this time. We realize this is disappointing news to hear, and we apologize<br />
for the inconvenience we have caused you.</p></blockquote>
