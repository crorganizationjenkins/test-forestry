excerpt: 'Apparently, we weren''t the only ones upset by what Consumerist commenter
  Hawkins described as Google''s "capitulation to the commie bastards"... although
  he followed it up with: "But I submit that a constant reminder, every time you search,
  that you''re being dicked again by your government is better than nothing." Which
  are the exact words that Google themselves should have used at the press conference.
  You might want to submit your C.V. to Google P.R., Hawkins.'

<p>Apparently, we weren't the only ones upset by what Consumerist commenter Hawkins described as Google's "capitulation to the commie bastards"... although he followed it up with: "But I submit that a constant reminder, every time you search, that you're being dicked again by your government is better than nothing." Which are the exact words that Google themselves should have used at the press conference. You might want to submit your C.V. to Google P.R., Hawkins.</p>
<p>To return to our point &mdash; Pajamas Media has started up a new blog on the current trend of American companies spinelessly capitulating to China's censorship-happy government. <a href="http://blogs.pajamasmedia.com/china_syndrome/">It's called China Syndrome</a>. It appears to be a fairly objective look at the subject, posting an image of Google founders as Dr. Evil and Mini-Me right above a post pointing out that Google has also gone along with silent censorship of bomb-making instructions in the US. Which we at the Consumerist feel is just as bad, since planning for the violent overthrow of a tyrannical government is your constitutional right.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2134899/">Slate also has a good round-up of the blogosphere's reaction to Google.cn.</a> There certainly appears to be no shortage of opinions on this one. Not that there ever is on the Internet, but still.</p>
