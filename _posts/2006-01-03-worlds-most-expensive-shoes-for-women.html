excerpt: Ladies love them shoes, says fashion watchdog Forbes.com.Cohen estimates
  that shoes costing $1,000 and up account for less than 1% of total women's fashion
  footwear sales (fashion footwear is defined as anything other than athletic), but
  he acknowledges a growing group of women willing to pay more for their shoes now
  than they ever have been before. "It changed as early as a year-and-a-half ago but
  picked up steam in the past six months. Women consider footwear their signature
  item now."Oddly enough, we consider women's feet our signature item, although we've
  been advised to stop wearing them to Sunday School.
