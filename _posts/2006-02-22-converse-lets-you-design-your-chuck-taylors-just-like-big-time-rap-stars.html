<p>If you're possessed by an attraction towards nostalgic ankle-breakers, you may enjoy designing your own "Chuck Talyor" aka "Chucks" aka "Converse All-Star" shoes <a href="http://www.converse.com/converseone/default.asp?mid=&prodid=chuTaySliOx0601&csid=76&bhcp=1">here</a>.</p>
<p>3-4 weeks and $45-$65 + $7 shipping later, your personalized pair arrives.</p>
<p>You can even add your own ID, as long as it doesn't say any trademarked/offensive words, phrases or color combinations or ruthlessly guarded celebrity names, like "Heidi Klum" (whose father recently tried to sue a blogger for using the name, trademarked, in a  <a href="http://www.werbeblogger.de/index.php/2005/12/30/fanilie_klum_lasst_grusen">blog post title</a> (German)).</p>
<p>Pictured is our special "Consumerist" version Chuck Taylor, full view <a href="http://www.converse.com/converseone/default.asp?mid=38411662&prodid=converse_hi_0904">here</a>. Notice the seamless flow of butt-ugly design from website to footwear.</p>
