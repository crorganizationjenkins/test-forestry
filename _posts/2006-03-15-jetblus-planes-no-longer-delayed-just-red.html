<p>Gawker Media's Honorary-and-Most-Valuable-Unpaid-Employee, sent in this pic:</p></p>
<p>Picture-taker <a href="http://www.animalnewyork.com">Bucky Turco</a> wrote, "Couldn't they just say delayed like everyone else? Fuckin flight was an 1 hour and 45 minutes late last night."</p>
<p>We didn't quite understand and asked him, "So you find yourself enraged by the color red?" This didn't seem such a strange proposition having met Bucky and knowing him to be built like a bull.</p>
<p>Bucky replied, "No sir. Actually the lack of transparency. For like 30 years they call that situation: Delayed. There are no green bars for on time are there? Nope, it just says it."</p>
<p>Yeah, what's up with that?</p>
