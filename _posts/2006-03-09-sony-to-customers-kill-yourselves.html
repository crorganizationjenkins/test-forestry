excerpt: Sony might want to start rethinking their subversive ad strategy. First,
  they came under fire for paying street hooligans to spray paint their logos on private
  property. And now, in London, they are posting advertisements openly encouraging
  their customers to kill themselves.

<p>Sony might want to start rethinking their subversive ad strategy. First, they came under fire for paying street hooligans to spray paint their logos on private property. And now, in London, they are posting advertisements openly encouraging their customers to kill themselves.</p>
<p>To the left, you'll see an advertisement for the Sony Playstation 2 that &mdash; up until recently &mdash; was on display at the London Picadilly station. In a blood red font juxtaposed against the blank infinity of death, Sony encourages its viewers to toss themselves underneath the sharp, churning wheels of an oncoming subway car.</p>
<p>We're not advertising geniuses or anything, but it seems to us that &mdash; unless you're marketing exclusively to goths &mdash;  there's better strategies to get new customers than by trying to convince them to commit suicide. Coming up next: Sony gives shotguns to hopped-up Vietnam Vets covered in invisible insects and pays them to begin shooting random people in the face while screaming "Playstation!"</p>
