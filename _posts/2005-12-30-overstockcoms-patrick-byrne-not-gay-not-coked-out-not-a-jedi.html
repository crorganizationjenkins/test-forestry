<p>Overstock.com's CEO Patrick Byrne is a man who enjoys his crazy in bulk. Although the company continues to grow year-to-year, Byrne is doing his best to dissuade investors from giving him any of their money to burn.</p>
<p>After a December 23rd call to investors, his company's stock mysteriously took a dive, according to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/29/overstock_stock_dip/">The Register</a></p>
<blockquote><p>During the session, Byrne admitted to making up stories about being gay and a coke-head in the hopes of uncovering a mysterious group short-sellers led by a "Sith Lord." These individuals allegedly engineered an intricate conspiracy to cripple Overstock. Part of the conspiracy included tapping Byrne's phone calls and apparently some kind of spy ring.</p></blockquote>
<p>We can't imagine where investors' insecurity might come from.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time El Reg has <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/03/overstock_issues/">taken a swipe at Overstock.com</a>. That piece is worth reading not just for Byrne's ramblings, but for its details about the sub-standard service some customers have been receiving as Overstock continues to grow.</p>
