And just when you thought the Andre Has a Posse fad was completely dead, obnoxiously overused, and forever buried in the annals of the late 1990's-earl 2000's,<br />
 writes in <a href="http://www.animalnewyork.com">Bucky Turco</a>,<br />
Rupert Murdoch [tries to] make it relevant again or according to them, *super-cool.*</p>
<p>That<br />
s right, you can download Obey Giant and other 'iconoclastic' Shepard Fairey 'grafix' as wallpapers for your cellphone from <a href="http://www.mobizzo.com/us/home.do">Mobizzo.com</a>, a Newscorp entity.</p>
<p>As you may know...</p>
<p>Shepard Fairey was an artist who made Andre the Giant<br />
s head into a big poster with OBEY over it and GIANT underneath. After pasting it around town for a school project, he made the image available for others to use and it spread across the nation's city's blank walls, POST NO BILLS boards, and street signs, creating a counterculture phenomenon. Derivatives followed, including one emblazoned, "Andre Has a Posse." The graphics were wildly successful beyond their humble origins, eventually becoming a substantial commercial entity; a giant, obeyed by its own increasingly mainstream posse.</p>
<p>According to the latest incarnation, here<br />
s what<br />
s up with the Obey Giant:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Be curious, be confrontational. Obey Giant. Or, don't. That's the whole point. These grafix are super-cool, but if they make you think for yourself and question authority, all's the better. Because the medium is the message.
 </p></blockquote>
<p>Whatever that crock o<br />
 crap means.</p>
<p>Co-Option, it<br />
s a beautiful thing.</p>
