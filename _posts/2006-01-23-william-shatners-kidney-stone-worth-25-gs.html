<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/kidneystone.jpg"></a>Unfortunately, we at the Consumerist missed this last week, preventing us from actually posting it in our Morning Deal's Round-Up - maybe one of you guys could have outbid. But coming soon to Golden Palace (appropriate, given the method of evacuation), a piece of William Shatner. <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060118/ap_on_en_mo/people_shatner">Specifically, his passed kidneystone.</a> </p>
<p>Imagine, only $25,000 dollars to own the jagged concretion forcibly pushed out of Captain Kirk's urethra! Of course, there's a lot of things you can do with an item like this. Putting it in a sling shot and shooting Leonard Nimoy right in the middle of the forehead comes to mind. Putting it in a bag of your favorite Trekkie's Goldfish crackers is another. </p>
<p>Shatner seems to have a good sense of humor about it too:</p>
<blockquote><p>The stone was so big, Shatner said, "you'd want to wear it on your finger."</p>
<p>"If you subjected it to extreme heat, it might turn out to be a diamond," he added.</p>
<p>Shatner said the idea of selling the stone came up after "Boston Legal" raised $20,000 for Habitat for Humanity. With the money for the stone, Shatner said there is about enough funding to build half a house.</p>
<p>GoldenPalace.com originally offered $15,000 for the stone but Shatner turned it down, noting that his "Star Trek" tunics have commanded more than $100,000. His counteroffer was accepted.</p>

<p>
You know you're a star when you can buy half a house for something that you fished out of your toilet one morning.</p>
