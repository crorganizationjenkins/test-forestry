excerpt: Mr. Jarvis has had much in the way of Christmas-time delivery problems, with
  at least four packages having issues with both Fedex and USPS. Others in his thread
  have had plenty of problems with the big three shippers, as well.

<p>Mr. Jarvis has had much in the way of Christmas-time delivery problems, with at least four packages having issues with both Fedex and USPS. Others in his <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2005/12/25/has-anyone-else/#comments">thread</a> have had plenty of problems with the big three shippers, as well.</p>
<p>It seems to us that the level of service with each company tends to vary depending on the temerity of your local delivery driver and the thoroughness of your local distribution center. For instance, at our current location, UPS is dreamy, while at our last apartment, UPS was a guarantee of broken items and shattered dreams of on-time receipt.</p>
<p>But still, we love to hear your pain. What haven't you received via post or shipment, and what are the companies you ordered from going to do about it?</p>
