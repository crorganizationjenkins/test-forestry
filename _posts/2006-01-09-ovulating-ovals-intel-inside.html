excerpt: The oval is the go-to shape for logos looking to vaguely state, "We're ready
  to take you in a lazy orbit around our life-giving brand." In honor of Intel's new

  into one conflicting jumble of brandiness.

<p>The oval is the go-to shape for logos looking to vaguely state, "We're ready to take you in a lazy orbit around our life-giving brand." In honor of Intel's new logo, Hurty Elbow has <a href="http://hurtyelbow.typepad.com/hurtyelbow/2006/01/logo_ovalation_.html">collected a couple dozen logos</a> for you to peruse and confuse into one conflicting jumble of <i>brandiness</i>.</p>
<p>He also astutely pegs the next evolution in non-offensive logos: Ovals that will tilt to the right. We take it to the next level: Right-tilting ovals with gradiants with&mdash;wait for it&mdash;beveled text.</p>
