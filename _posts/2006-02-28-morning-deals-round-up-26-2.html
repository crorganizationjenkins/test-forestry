<p>&bull; Yes, today is Free Pancake Day at International House of Pancakes, from 7AM to 2PM. We won't be joining you as there aren't any IHOPS near us, but we are with you in syrup.</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon has the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BO0SGG/ref=nosim/102-0392434-9450502?n=172282">Seagate 8GB CompactFlash Photo Storage Hard Drive</a> for $150. These tiny hard drives don't offer the greatest speed, but if you don't shoot five frames-a-second, you'll probably do just fine with them. (Of course, if you don't shoot five frames-a-second, why do you need 8GB of storage?)</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://dealnews.com">DealNews</a> tells us about the <a href="http://dealnews.com/deals/Sears-Mattress-Sale-50-off-Sealy-Serta-more/111558.html">Sears Matress Sale</a>, with some items up to 50% off plus free shipping on orders over $400 (although that involves a rebate).</p>
<p><i>A little slow today, deals-wise, but you've got to admit: pancakes, hard drives, and mattresses is particularly poetic (and unintentional).</i></p>
