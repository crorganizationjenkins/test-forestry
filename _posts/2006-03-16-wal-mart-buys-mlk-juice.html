<p>Wal-Mart purchased another gilt bullhorn, this time, in the form of a former aide to Martin Luther King Jr.</p></p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/2006-03-15-young-walmart-usat_x.htm">USA TODAY</a>: </p>
<ul>"Andrew Young, one of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s top aides, a former United Nations ambassador and former mayor of Atlanta, announced last month that he would head a group formed to spread the word about the positive contributions of Wal-Mart Stores."</p>
<p>"I got involved with Wal-Mart because I think Wal-Mart is making middle-class lifestyles available to poor people. ... I agreed to chair the (national steering) committee of Working Families for Wal-Mart because there was another side of the story that wasn't being told," he says.</p>
<p>His company, GoodWorks International, is being paid an undisclosed amount to help promote Wal-Mart through interviews, speeches and editorials. One of Young's goals, he says, is to get the retailer into Africa." </p>
</ul>
<p>Can we say "commodifying credibility?"</p>
<p>Is this another bright idea from the Edelman PR firm? These guys would hire Jesus to preach how God "bathes humanity in the magnanimous glow of His blue-light special."</p>
<p>This is the same tactic as putting a hot chick next to a toaster in an ad, hoping to give the toaster sex appeal. There's a flip-side to that transference equation: the girl comes out looking like, by dint of association, an appliance.</p>
<p>Until they implement the systemic changes to its policies and practices necessary to be a "good company," Wal-Mart's street cred is not going to be improved by shopping for spokespersons, whether they're <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/walmart/source-email-from-walmarts-blogtrusion-158956.php">bloggers</a> or former civil rights activists. Rather, Wal-Mart will continue to look like a gaping sore and its avatars will emerge besmirched. At least Andrew Young and his fellow shills will have a room full of money with which to dip his wounded conscience in.</p>
