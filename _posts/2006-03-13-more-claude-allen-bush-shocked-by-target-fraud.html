  I heard the story last night, I was shocked, and my first reaction was one of disappointment,

<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/bush-allen.jpg"></a>Bush on Claude Allen's recent arrest for refund fraud at Target: "When I heard the story last night, I was shocked, and my first reaction was one of disappointment, deep disappointment - if it's true - that we were not fully informed. Shortly thereafter, I felt really sad for the Allen family."</p>
<p>The man's a politican after all, so we won't fault Bush for his first thoughts being of the political ramifications of hiring as one of his top advisers a petty shoplifter, as opposed to thinking first of Allen's family, who at least got that bitching Bose home stereo system out of the deal.</p>
<p>Apparently, the White House was notified in early February of the charges, but as Allen had passed a White House background check, he was given the benefit of the doubt. But really, between the Vice President accidentally shooting a septuagenarian recently and now a top adviser caught indulging in a sort of trailer-trash kleptomania at a department store, you've really got to start wondering what exactly those background checks entail.</p>
