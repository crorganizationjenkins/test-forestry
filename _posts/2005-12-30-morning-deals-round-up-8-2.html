<p>&bull; If yesterday's $20 boxed set of <i>Firefly</i> snuck by you (as it did us), take advantage of today's $22 deal from <a href="http://www.buy.com/retail/Product.asp?sku=40231032&adid=17662&adid=17662">Buy.com</a>. Slow shipping is free. [via <a href="http://slickdeals.net">Slickdeals</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; If you've got some time this morning, have a gander at <a href="http://www.alexscoupons.com/">Alex's Coupons</a>, a bargain site that helps support a <a href="http://www.alexscoupons.com/about.html">young girl with leukemia</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/548166//002-2776641-2416065">Friday Sale</a> lives, including the crazy deep discounts on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005AWCA/ref=br_lf_outlet_19/002-2776641-2416065?n=548166&s=outlet&v=glance">Calphalon</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002808JS/ref=br_lf_outlet_1/002-2776641-2416065?n=548166&s=outlet&v=glance">pans</a>. Don't forget to use the <b>HOHOHOHO</b> code for $25 off $125 in Housewares, should it apply.</p>
<p>&bull; Best Buy is selling the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=7457316&type=product&id=1488124">complete Mr. Show collection</a> for $40. You've got to follow your balloon.</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot</a>! The refurbished HP F1903 19 inch LCD Monitor for $245, shipped. Not a bad deal in general, but not amazing. If you're feeling up to a rebate, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824168005">Newegg</a> has the Fujiplus FP-988D Silver-Black 19" 12MS monitor for $290 with a $90 mail-in rebate, plus shipping.</p>
<p><i>Update: Reader Rob offers this dissent: Eck. "These [Fujiplus] are horrible monitors, and $200 is actually a high price for them. I've seen them down in the $170s. They are not made by Fuji, the Japanese firm that makes decent cameras, but instead by some low-quality manufacturer. Check out their Web site, http://www.mmitek.com/." Informed!</i></p>
