<p>Poor Europe. Our friends in the Old Countries are constantly being squeezed by American technology companies, with prices for items like electronics and software at a huge premium to their American equivalents.</p>
<p>Take Apple, for instance. Their new MacBook laptop goes for $1,999 here in the States, while the exact same machine in Europe goes for &euro;2,179&mdash;a $640 price difference at current exchange rates. (Purchasing in UK Pounds is a little better, at only a $520 premium.)</p>
<p>While some price difference is understandable&mdash;nothing wrong with taking a little advantage in an exchange rate, after all&mdash;technology buyers, so comfortable with online shopping and comparison, often feel more aware of the pinch more immediately than regular retail buyers.</p>
<p>So from America to you, European friends: <i>Sorry!</i> As Hexus.net points out, it's <a href="http://lifestyle.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=4443">not going to get any better soon</a>.</p>
<p><i>Update: A few people have pointed out that we're not taking the built-in VAT tax into account. Okay, fine! It's still more expensive, although not nearly as dramatic. You people are totally screwing with our ability to make mountains from molehills.</i></p>
