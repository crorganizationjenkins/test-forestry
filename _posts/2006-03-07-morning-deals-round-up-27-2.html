excerpt: "â€¢ SlickDeals is reporting that the Amazon coupon code TOOLDAYS, which is
  supposed to be just for tools, is working on nearly every item on Amazon to give
  a 10% discount. Try the 50OFFMAR code on Tools, too, to get $50 off $250. Good luck!"

<p>&bull; <a href="http://slickdeals.net">SlickDeals</a> is reporting that the Amazon coupon code <b>TOOLDAYS</b>, which is supposed to be just for tools, is working on nearly every item on Amazon to give a 10% discount. Try the <b>50OFFMAR</b> code on Tools, too, to get $50 off $250. Good luck!</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon also has a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/602926/102-0392434-9450502">50% off TV DVD sale</a>, with series like <i>Dead Like Me</i>, <i>All in the Family</i>, and <i>Barney Miller</i>. (Actually, that's pretty much all that's any good.)</p>
<p>&bull; ThinkGeek has the <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/security/78DF/?cpg=cj">Lazer Trip Wire</a> for $25, plus shipping. We don't know if that's a good price at all, but it sounds exactly like the sort of thing a little brother would like to use to protect his forts. [via <a href="http://dealnews.com">DealNews</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; It pains us to tell you this, but online shoe retailer Zappos has <a href="http://www.zappos.com/sale.zhtml?">another clearance sale</a>. Zappos is cheap and fast. Thankfully for us, we're moving and don't know our new address, so we cannot purchase.</p>
