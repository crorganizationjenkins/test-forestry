excerpt: It's bad when purchased electronics don't workâ€”it's even worse when they
  kill one's precious iPod. Eric Mortensen had a suspiciously bad run of luck with
  NewerTech's RoadTrip! FM transmitter for the iPod not once, but three times. The
  first one took a dive and killed his iPod, as well, probably because it plugs into
  the dock port of the MP3 player into his car's power outlet.

<p>It's bad for electronics to fail, but they should fail in such a way that they prevent unregulated power from being shot into attached gear. That seems like especially poor design.</p>
