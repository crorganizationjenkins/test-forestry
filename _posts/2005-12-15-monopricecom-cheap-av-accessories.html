<p>For years, we've advised people who need audio-visual accessories&mdash;especially the little stuff, like cables&mdash;to shop on eBay. And we still do&mdash;there are some great deals to be found out there. But the next time we need a component video cable or a fiber-optic audio Toslink cable, we're going to try Monoprice.com. Here's why:</p>
<p>They are cheap as hell and have a <a href="http://www.resellerratings.com/seller5664.html">totally decent Reseller Rating</a>.</p>
<p>A/V accessories are some of the most overblown, overpriced consumer products out there. In almost all cases, a cable is a cable, and companies like Best Buy make a killing selling you quality, but horrendously-priced products like those from Monster Cable.</p>
<p>We're giving Monoprice a shot. We just purchased three <a href="http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=102&cp_id=10229&cs_id=1022901&p_id=1419&seq=1&format=2&style=">generic 6-foot optical audio cables</a> from Monoprice for $10.79, shipped. For the same product from Best Buy (and we chose the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=4118154&productCategoryId=cat08057&type=product&id=1051384701228">cheaper, Acoustic Research brand</a>), the shipped price was $97.47 (again, for three).</p>
<p>Think someone is making some money somewhere?</p>
<p><i>Update: Reader Miriam sent in this handy guide to speaker/audio wires. The lesson? <a href="http://www.roger-russell.com/wire/wire.htm">cheap is fine</a>.</i></p>
