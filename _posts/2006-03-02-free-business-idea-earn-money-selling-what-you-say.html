<p>The 'Ebay for Voice Services' launches tonight to beta testers. Called <a href="http://www.ether.com">Ether</a>, it easily allows vendors to charge for people to call them or email them.</p>
<p>"Sellers set their price, from free to anything (on a per minute or per hour basis). They can tell Ether the hours they are willing to take calls. Every seller is issued a toll free phone number...which forwards to their phone."</p>
<p>A boon for phone-sex startups.</p>
