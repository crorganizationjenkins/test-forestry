<p>Nike Air Jordans repurposed by artists Brian Jungen into sculptures, pointed to us by <a href="http://www.obsessiveconsumption.com">ObsessiveConsumption</a>. Some of these resemble dinosaur skulls. Some of them are analogues for the route it takes to get a human on telephone customer service.</p>
<p>We can recall these shoes being the high priced Nike Air Jordans as being the raison d'etre for many a young lad back in the day. Even those without hoop dreams were lured by the selective mystique of the red, black and white shoe's siren song. Their proverbial minds would've been blown to see so many of the shoes gathered together, let alone ripped apart and restitched together for art.</p>
<p>There's a consumption/desire critique going on here, but we can't figure it out, can you help? </p>
