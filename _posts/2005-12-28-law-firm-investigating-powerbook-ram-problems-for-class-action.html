excerpt: We've heard many times that Apple Powerbooks are finicky about RAM (and that
  may be true), but it would appear that for owners of 15-inch Powerbooks, it might
  not be the memory that has the problem after all. A law firm is investigating claims
  that a fairly recent version of Mac OS X corrupted the firmware in the memory controller
  inside Apple Powerbooks, rendering the lower of two memory slots unusable.

<p>We've heard many times that Apple Powerbooks are finicky about RAM (and that may be true), but it would appear that for owners of 15-inch Powerbooks, it might not be the memory that has the problem after all.

<p>If you've had a problem with your 15-inch Powerbook, you'll probably want to <a href="https://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/case/apple_powerbook_classaction">fill out their form</a> to get a potential piece of the class action. Judging from the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2005/12/28/mac-os-x-updates-disable-and-or-damage-powerbook-memory-hardware/#comments">Engadget</a>, Powerbooks under warranty can have the problem fixed by replacing the logic board.</p>
