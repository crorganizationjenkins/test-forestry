excerpt: A fire in 575 Broadway occurred over the weekend with no loss of life, but
  perhaps over $5 million worth of loss to the Prada store, according to Gothamist.
  Other stores in the building, including American Eagle, also are pretty much smoked,
  as well as office spaces above, home to the likes of companies like Take 2, of Grand
  Theft Auto infamy.

<p>A fire in 575 Broadway occurred over the weekend with no loss of life, but perhaps over <a href="http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/01/23/no_clue_why_soh.php">$5 million worth of loss to the Prada store</a>, according to Gothamist. Other stores in the building, including American Eagle, also are pretty much smoked, as well as office spaces above, home to the likes of companies like Take 2, of <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/take-2/fivealarm-blaze-burns-take-2-office-149987.php">Grand Theft Auto</a> infamy.</p>
<p>The picture? The water-soaked floor of the Prada store, said to be covered in $800,000 of Brazilian zebra wood, via <a href="http://blog.verbosecoma.com/archives/hamishs-diary/fire_sale.php">Verbose Coma</a>. If you find yourself buying Prada bags on Canal Street, give a sniff. The smoke tinge means it might just be real.</p>
