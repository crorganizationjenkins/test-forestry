excerpt: Bits du Jour is a new site that will offer one discounted download for one
  day. It's like Woot! except for software or memberships. It remains to be seen what
  they'll be able to line up, but if you want to be on the front lines in case this
  is good and for reals, sign up at Bitsdujour.com.

<p>It's gotta be good. The site design boasts rounded rectangles with drop-shadows!</p>
