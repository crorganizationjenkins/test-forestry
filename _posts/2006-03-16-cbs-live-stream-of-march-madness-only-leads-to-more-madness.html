<ul>"So CBS is streaming NCAA bball live online today.  This is sweet.  Best idea ever. However, sometimes when you click in, you wonder why you signed up early to be a VIP."</ul></p>
<ul>"Sometimes the plebes have it."</ul>
<p>We like how in both the "proletarian" and "extra-crispy" flavored lines, there's a guy with his hands on his hips, standing to the side, looking slightly pissed. Presumably, that represents you, sucker.</p>
<p>Please, let the madness stop. Or is it start? We're not sure anymore. Of anything. It's all lies. Or marketing. There's a difference?</p>
