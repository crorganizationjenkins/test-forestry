<p>Get 'em <a href="http://order.1and1.com/xml/order/Instant;jsessionid=747BD88194018B3F3BDDC164A641E69F.TC61a?__frame=_top&__lf=Static&__sendingdata=1&dom=1">here</a>.</p>
<p>A few words of caution...</p>
<p>Registration requires a credit card. They will put a $6 charge on the card and then immediately reverse it. Some people have reported extreme difficulty in getting their account canceled with 1and1 (lame ads aside, we prefer <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">godaddy</a>). Others report a lackluster customer service. Also, the domain is only free for a year. After that, the standard rate applies.</p>
<p>Plus, you're then stuck with a .info domain when you really just get 1) a .com and 2) a thesaurus.</p>
