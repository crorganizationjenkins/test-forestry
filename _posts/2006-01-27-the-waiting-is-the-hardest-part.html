<p>Lest you think that we get pleasure out of bad service at restaurants, let's get one thing straight: There's nothing that pleases us more than to be able to immediately reward someone for doing a great job. Gratuity-based jobs are not without their faults, but as a customer it's got a lot going for it.</p>
<p>Which is why we were a little disturbed by reader Han K.'s admonishment to read Frank Bruni's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/25/dining/25note.html?_r=1&incamp=article_popular_1">My Week as a Waiter</a> in The <i>Times</i> (accompanied ominously by this iPod-esque graphic of a waiter about to launch into a flying roundhouse kick). Han said:<br />
<blockquote>An important factor of being a good consumer besides finding the best deals is also being a good person not just being very demanding or complaining about bad service.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people seem to think just b/c they're the consumer they can be rude or unreasonable.Sure, fine, that's reasonable, but if one more server brings my steak tartar without the tartar sauce...</p>
