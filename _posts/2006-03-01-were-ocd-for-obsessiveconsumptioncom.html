<p>
Have you heard of <a href="http://obsessiveconsumption.com/">ObsessiveConsumption.com</a>?</p>
<p>It's pretty sweet!</p>
<p>Among the many things this girl, Kate Bingaman, does is make drawings of things she buys. She also draws her monthly credit card bills and sews these nifty dollar-shaped pillows. Also, she takes cool pictures of esoterica-searching shopping trips. </p>
<p>Kate makes shopping fun and cool. Thank you Kate. You are a nice person.</p>
<p>Consider it the doppelganger version of <em>The Consumerist</em> as she:</p>
<p>1) Enjoys shopping.<br />
2) Puts up original content instead of mainly remixing and pissing on the work of others.<br />
3) Has a site both visually pleasing and enjoyable to navigate.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://obsessiveconsumption.com/">ObsessiveConsumption.com</a>.</p>
