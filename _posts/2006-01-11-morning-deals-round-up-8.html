excerpt: "â€¢ We continue to be baffled by Amazon's ridiculously low prices on cookware
  recently, like this Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 6-Quart Sauce Pot with Lid
  for just $14. They must have over-purchased for the holidays. [via Slickdeals] Update:
  Reader Kim L. confirmed that the price is showing as $40 for her. It still shows
  $14 for us (although they are out of stock). A mystery!"

<p>&bull; We continue to be baffled by Amazon's ridiculously low prices on cookware recently, like this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008CM6I/ref=nosim/102-0392434-9450502?n=284507">Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 6-Quart Sauce Pot with Lid</a> for just $14. They must have over-purchased for the holidays. [via <a href="http://slickdeals.net">Slickdeals</a>] <i>Update: Reader Kim L. confirmed that the price is showing as $40 for her. It still shows $14 for us (although they are out of stock). A mystery!</i></p>
<p>&bull; Eddie Bauer is holding a <a href="http://www.eddiebauer.com/eb/default.asp?cm_ven=Performics&cm_cat=Affiliate&cm_pla=Tier3&cm_ite=Tier3">60% off winter sale</a> on clothing for women and men, as well as 'gear.' The online outlet follows suit with an <a href="http://www.eddiebaueroutlet.com/?cm_ven=Performics&cm_cat=Affiliate&cm_pla=Tier3&cm_ite=Tier3&OESSOA=6046118">additional 5% off</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; If you squeeze your shopping in this morning, <a href="http://gamestop.com">Gamestop.com</a> has free shipping until 11am PST for orders over $75. Use code: 3DAY75. </p>
<p>&bull; And since it wouldn't be indicative of the hopelessness of fighting the American cellular telephone hegemony to complain about a company on the <i>same day</i> you post a deal for their product, Cingular is offering the <a href="http://www.dealhack.com/archives/2006/01/cingular_rim_blackberry_8700c.html">RIM Blackberry 8700c</a> for $150 with a $150 rebate with a (probably two-year) contract. </p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a>: A 250GB hard drive for $55. Not a had deal at all <i>if it were new</i>. Unfortunately, these drives are refurbished, and god knows what happened to them before Woot got them in stock. We'd say pass&mdash;hard drives are fragile enough as it is.</p>
