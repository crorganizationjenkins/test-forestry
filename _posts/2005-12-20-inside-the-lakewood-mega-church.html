excerpt: 'We are fascinated by Lakewood Church of Houston, Texas, who recently (well,
  the last year or so) completed the renovation of the Houston Rockets arena into
  their new 92 million dollar worship complex. (We first wrote about them here.)  Boxtank,
  a site that concerns itself with the buildings left over by Wal-Mart and other big
  box retailers, has a special report about the Lakewood complex, detailing one woman''s
  adventure into the heart of godness. Just one tidbit: 40 police officers patrol
  the complex during Sunday service.'

<p>We are fascinated by Lakewood Church of Houston, Texas, who recently (well, the last year or so) completed the renovation of the Houston Rockets arena into their new 92 million dollar worship complex. (We first wrote about them <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/bulk/megachurches-why-pray-more-133391.php">here</a>.)  Boxtank, a site that concerns itself with the buildings left over by Wal-Mart and other big box retailers, has a special report about the Lakewood complex, detailing one woman's adventure into the heart of godness. Just one tidbit: 40 police officers patrol the complex during Sunday service.</p>
<p>We are still kicking ourselves for not taking in a service when last we were in Houston. It certainly seems from the report that tourists are more than welcome.</p>
