excerpt: The RIAA says ripping CDs to your iPod is illegal.
---
<p>The RIAA says ripping CDs to your iPod is illegal.</p>
<p>That<br />
s the substance of a filing submitted by the RIAA during the ongoing digital copyright wrangling in Washington.</p>
<p>This maneuver reneges on their statement made during <em>MGM v Grokster</em> that,<br />
it<br />
s perfectly lawful to take a CD, upload it to your computer, put it on your iPod.</p>
<p>Similarly, the same filing said,<br />
creating a back-up copy of a music CD is not a non-infringing use.</p>
<p>We<br />
re just going to strap on a phonograph and only listen to honky-tonk cartridges.</p>
