excerpt: Over in Vietnam, various regulations prevent you from naming a .vn domain
  after a body part approximately 50% of people on Earth have. Recently however, this
  aggressive stance towards clean, wholesome domain names has backfired on the clean,
  wholesome Vietnamese grapefruit which, without its tonal accents, is a filthy homonym
  for a cock.

<p>Sayeth Thai Huu Ly, of the Vietnam Internet Network Information Centre: "We have to refuse the website name of www.buoi.com.vn because the word for grapefruit, buoi, without a proper tone marking can be misunderstood."</p>
