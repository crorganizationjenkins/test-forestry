excerpt: Robin G. writes:So, the Apple iPod Settlement website FAQ said there would
  be a result by September 20th 2005, but the front page now says that on December
  22nd 2005 the settlement is final and it's just a case of the Settlement Administrator
  moving forward with "claims administration and claims fulfillment."

<p>Meanwhile I find myself being increasingly drawn towards surfing websites selling aftermarket batteries for my dead 3G iPod, because, dammit, I miss my music.</p>
<p>Should we just sit it out, or should we take to the streets of Cupertino, torching pedestrians and SUVs until we get our way?</p>
<p>Got any good slogans to shout?It's been a month since the settlement was Final. Has anyone else received their recompense?</p>
