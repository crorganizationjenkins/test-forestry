<p>Plunking down the paper just got a little more fun with the introduction of the new, swishier, $10 bill yesterday.</p>
<p>As if having Alexander Hamilton, former Secretary of the Treasury wasn't gay enough (hellooooo, male secretary!), they added dramatic touches of orange, yellow and red colors to the $10 bill as anti-counterfeiting measures. That leaves just Blue, Indigo and Violet to make a truly friendly and fetch ROYGBIV currency.</p>
<p>However, no plans are in the works for colorizing the $1 bill. A shame. Our eyes will have to look elsewhere for color and distraction    on nights out at the Pink Carousel.</p>
