excerpt: 'Here''s a quick tip that''s worth the trouble, we think: 1-800-FREE-411
  (373-3411) is a totally free directly service. How do they make money?The way it
  works in practice is that a caller who requests a business number is first presented
  with a short (about 12 seconds) audio advertisement for a sponsor who operates a
  competing business in that area; the caller is then given the option of being connected
  to either that competitor or the business he originally requested. If no sponsor
  operates a local competing business, then the caller hears no advertisement at all.So
  you''ll wait a hair longer than you would with your phone company''s directory service,
  but we think 10-to-15 seconds of easily-ignored ads are worth the $2 or more charge
  you''ll often receive.'
