<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/chatterboxfreespeech.jpg"></a>Bad news for the loveless or those who have to endure the unskilled, pedestrian gropings of their lovers in Mississippi: selling sex toys is still illegal.</p>
<p>There was some hope that this morally-pompous Mississippi law banning the sale of sex toys to consenting adults would be successfully challenged by a lawsuit  brought to federal court in 2004, arguing that the ban on sex toys violated your right to free speech. That lawsuit has now been overturned.</p>
<p>We don't want to side with some asexual Mississippi prude on this, but unless you're <a href="http://www.coldfusionvideo.com/c/chatterbox.html">Chatterbox</a>, what you do with your penis and vagina doesn't technically qualify as speech, no matter how absurdly large the device you insert into it is.</p>
<p>But likewise, a dildo's not likely to hurt anyone... making this law less about public welfare and entirely about denying customers a legal product based upon the prudery of a powerful minority.</p>
