<p>Little ol' <a href="http://pricegrabber.com">PriceGrabber</a> has been picked up by the UK holdings company that also controls Experian for $485 million. How does that affect you, the shopper?</p>
<p>No freaking clue, because we're just about as useless when it comes to big business as you. But we're moderately fond of Pricegrabber, which is the number-three shopping comparison site <a href="http://news.com.com/Britains+GUS+buys+PriceGrabber/2100-1014_3-5994755.html">behind Shopzilla and Shopping.com</a>.</p>
<p>In honor of their windfall, we ask you this: what's your favorite feature of Pricegrabber? And of course, what's your most hated?</p>
