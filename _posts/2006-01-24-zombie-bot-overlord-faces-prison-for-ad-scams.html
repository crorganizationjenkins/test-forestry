<p><a href="http://news.moneycentral.msn.com/ticker/article.asp?Feed=AP&Date=20060123&ID=5439454&Symbol=US:MSFT">Another malware scammer bites the dust:</a><br />
<blockquote> Starting in August 2004, Ancheta turned to a new, more lucrative method to profit from his botnets, prosecutors said. Working with a juvenile in Boca Raton, Fla., whom prosecutors identified by his Internet nickname "SoBe," Ancheta infected more than 400,000 computers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ancheta and SoBe signed up as affiliates in programs maintained by online advertising companies that pay people each time they get a computer user to install software that displays ads and collects information about the sites a user visits.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say Ancheta and SoBe then installed the ad software from the two companies -- Gamma Entertainment of Montreal, Quebec, and Loudcash, whose parent company was acquired last year by 180Solutions of Bellevue, Wash. -- on the bots they controlled, pocketing more than $58,000 in 13 months.</p>
<p>"It's immoral, but the money makes it right," Ancheta told SoBe during one online chat, according to the indictment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/zombie-baby.jpg"></a>Out of curiosity, what is the difference between a kid like this and, say, <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/sony/">Sony</a>? Both infected tens of thousands of computers with malware. Both espouse the same philosophy to justify that infection&mdash;<br />
the money makes it right.</p>
<p>At first blush, it seems pretty similar. Given that, there<br />
s really only a couple of differences. The first is that Ancheta<br />
s network merely preyed on insecure systems, where as Sony<br />
s network actually <em>made</em> systems insecure, opening them up to further infection by guys <em>like</em> Ancheta. And the second is that, when caught, the kid goes to jail, where as Sony<br />
s team of lawyers just have to pay you <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/drm/sony-settles-rootkit-class-action-part-the-first-145903.php">seven dollars and fifty cents worth of imaginary money.</a></p>
<p>By the way, notice that the ad network Ancheta used&mdash;Loudcash&mdash;was acquired by 180solutions, who are <em>also</em> under investigation for <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060123/ap_on_hi_te/adware_complaint">being scumware jerks.</a></p>
