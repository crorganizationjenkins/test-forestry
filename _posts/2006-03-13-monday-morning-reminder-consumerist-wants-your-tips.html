<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/kermitcommenting.jpg"></a>Just a reminder that if you've found a story you'd like to see here, have an anecdote (bad or good) about a company or just want to give feedback about the tone and direction of this site, <a href="mailto:tips@consumerist.com">The Consumerist wants to hear from you</a>.</p>
<p>For one, it allows the editors here at the Consumerist to make our post quota and fill our pockets with Gawker's ill-gotten lucre without actually having to hunt down stories ourselves. But more importantly: this is your site. The Consumerist isn't Joel Johnson or Ben Popken or myself, but rather, it's you guys. We want to know the consumer issues you're concerned with. We want to know your bad experiences with companies and escalate them if we can. We want to follow-up the stories you're most interested in. We need to hear from you to get a better feel for the very issues we're trying to cover.</p>
<p>So if you've got an anecdote about a bad experience with a company, we'd like you to tell us about it. If you see a story on Slate and think to yourselves "This is the kind of story I'd like to see on The Consumerist", send it in. Likewise, if we seem to be focusing on a specific aspect of consumerist affairs and you don't think that's particularly interesting or helpful, let us know. If you're looking for advice on how to deal with Customer Service Reps or deal with your credit card company, write us and we'll see if we can't get our thoughtful stable of regular commenters on the case. And if you want to be one of our commenters, write us and we'll hook you up with an account.</p>
<p>The email address is <a href="mailto:tips@consumerist.com">tips@consumerist.com</a>. Write us if you can think of anything &mdash; we'd really like everyone who reads this site to become more involved. Companies think they have us at a disadvantage &mdash; they know we both <em>need</em> and <em>love</em> to consume. What they don't seem to realize is that we don't always complain with our mouths full.</p>
