excerpt: Although the recall for the Stihl MS 192 Chain Saw is not nearly as gory
  as we might have hoped, the fact that the chain saws can "leak fuel" and then spark
  to create a fire leads to some interesting mangling opportunities. It would, however,
  make the chopping down of trees for heat a more efficient process.
