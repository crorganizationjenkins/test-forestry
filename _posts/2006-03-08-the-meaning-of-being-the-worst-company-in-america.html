<p>A thought: the companies duking it out in the "Worst Company in America" aren't up there because they have bad customer service or because they fail to deliver the best product at the best price.</p>
<p>They're there because they're convenient avatars for bigger issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wal-Mart symbolizes our concern with the head of hyper-aggressive capitalism eating its tail.
</li>
<li>Halliburton encapsulates a discussion about global business' undue political influence.
</li>
<li>SonyBMG is the erosion of the public domain to enrich corporate interests.
</li>
<li>And H&R Block reflects the growing unease with little green boxes.</li>
</ul>
