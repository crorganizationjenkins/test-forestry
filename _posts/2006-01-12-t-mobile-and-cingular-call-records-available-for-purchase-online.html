<p>Lest you think your cell phone records were private&mdash;even if you are a high-profile candidate for the U.S. presidency&mdash;AMERICAblog has proved you incorrect by <a href="http://americablog.blogspot.com/2006/01/americablog-just-bought-general-wesley.html">purchasing General Wesley Clark's cell phone records for $89.95</a>. </p>
<p>From AMERICAblog: "<i>All we needed was General Clark's cell phone number and our credit card, and 24 hours later we had one hundred calls the general made on his cell phone in November. The calls included a number of calls to Arkansas, to foreign countries, and at least one call to a prominent reporter at the Washington Post.</i>"</p>
<p>The records in question are from the Omnipoint Communications, part of T-Mobile. It would appear that records from Cingular are also available for purchase.</p>
