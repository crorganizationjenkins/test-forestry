excerpt: While we stand by our conviction that customer service agents are often lack-witted
  bobbins designed to unravel our will to complain, we also acknowledge that some
  customers are slobbering, batshit animals. And since we can't record ourselves calling
  in and being a prick, because we are always the most gentle of breezes, we're glad
  that some folks doing old-school technical support for Apple for the foresight to
  record customers plotzing out over their Apple II's.

<p>Strangely, these calls sound like they could have been recorded yesterday. Crazy spans the ages.</p>
