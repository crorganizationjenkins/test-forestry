<p>Our little group of dedicated commentors have impressed upon us once again how important a community is for cutting through the confusion of daily consumerism. So we want some more of you to join in the conversation. If you'd like a comments invite, just email joel@consumerist with the subject 'Comments Invite' and we'll see what we can do. If you've recently sent in a tip, you're probably already in queue, so no need to double up unless you just really want to impress us.</p>
<p>Or as it would be framed by the undead minions who serve as our graphical inspiration: <i>Join us.</i></p>
