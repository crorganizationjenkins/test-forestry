<p>&bull; <a href="http://dell.eprize.net/regifting/">Dell Game!</a> Guess what we won today? What is the opposite of our dignity?</p>
<p>&bull; Get five free <a href="http://www.irwin.com/irwin/consumer/jhtml/blueBladeRegistration8-8-05.jhtml;jsessionid=Y3WR2DVMHVUDOCQHUBSCF3QKA4QGIJCK">Irwin Blue Blade Bi-Metal Utility Blades</a> by filling out a survey form. Arm panty hose and Livejournal/myspace account not included.</p>
<p>&bull; This <a href="http://calraisins.org/request/">2006 California Raisins calendar</a> has a serious lack of claymation motown fruits on it, and does not compare in the least to the stunning calendar we received from our Chinese food delivery guy, with a picture of a swimsuit girl pasted in front of a Ferarri pasted in front of the White House.</p>
<p>&bull; And a little self-shilling for our New York City readers. Tonight, The Consumerist will be helping with F&Uuml;NDE RAZOR, where we'll be raffling a bevy of prizes, including one brand new Microsoft Xbox 360 Premium. Come on out to Barcade in Brooklyn if you have a chance to drink good beer, play video games, and raise money for the Children's Hospital at Montefiore via the Child's Play Charity. Get all your details <a href="http://joeljohnson.com/archives/2005/12/fnde_razor_win.html">here</a>.</p>
