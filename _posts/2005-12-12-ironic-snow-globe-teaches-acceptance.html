excerpt: When once we lived next to the Brooklyn side of the Manhattan Bridge, we
  were delighted to find that each rain storm taught us a little bit about how recycling
  works in New York City. We would stand on the edge of the roof, looking down to
  the torrent of water rushed from what we imagined was the eastern end of Long Island
  into the East River, each gallon of water carrying the cast off packaging of a million
  purchases. Each plastic bag and juice box washed into the river and was sucked directly
  to the bottom, where the crushing weight of the water compressed the trash back
  into its original state. Commercial divers sank to the depths to recover the reconstituted
  trees and tie off bladders of crude oil and fruit to their belts.

<p>This "I Heart NY Snow Globe" from the New York Public Library shop honors nature's miraculous process and reminds us all to give a little back this Holiday season by chucking our shopping bags to the nearest crosstown wind. (<i>Thanks, Steeltoe!</i>)</p>
