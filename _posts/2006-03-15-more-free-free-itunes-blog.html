excerpt: Like we said earlier today, we absolutely love free. Complaints start when
  we start paying, when we enter a contract with a company and — time and time again,
  almost invariably — they forget about our contracts and start lumping us up in with
  the faceless aggregate. But there's no lapsed service, no patronizing Customer Service
  exchanges when things are free — free is consumerist utopia.

<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/pepsifreesong.jpg"></a>Like we said earlier today, we absolutely love free. Complaints start when we start paying, when we enter a contract with a company and &mdash; time and time again, almost invariably &mdash; they forget about our contracts and start lumping us up in with the faceless aggregate. But there's no lapsed service, no patronizing Customer Service exchanges when things are free &mdash; free is consumerist utopia.</p>
<p>So we were delighted when fire-of-our-loins <strike>Gina Trapani</strike>... um... Matt Haughey over at Lifehacker pointed out this blog detailing all the stuff you can get for free over iTunes. Oh, it's not all cream &mdash; Dolly Parton's on there. But well worth adding to your RSS feed, if only to download the occasional song through iTunes that isn't helping fund the RIAA's  lawsuit campaign against small children and lonely old grandmas without a computer.</p>
