<p>While I think we can all agree that what happened to Chris Dotson&mdash;getting scammed out of over three grand on eBay and Paypal&mdash;sucks to high heaven, he raises a more interesting point at the end of his post: Is there a market for a third-party eBay scam collection service?</p>
<p>Consider Dotson's case: Even though he won the PayPal dispute, he still only received a $175 credit&mdash;Paypal just doesn't cover anything more than that. If a collection agency went after the scammer, even with typical 40 to 50% collection fees, Dotson would still be up at least another $1,500.</p>
<p>Who's going to start the first eBay detective agency? Maybe one of those 'We sell your stuff on eBay' stores could do it on the side.</p>
