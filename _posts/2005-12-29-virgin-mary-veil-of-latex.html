<p><a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=domesticNews&storyID=2005-12-22T182245Z_01_SPI253021_RTRUKOC_0_US-RELIGION-US-CONDOM.xml&archived=False">Quite the boner:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>An advertisement for a statue of the Virgin Mary veiled in a condom has embarrassed the publishers of the U.S. Catholic magazine America, and prompted some heated comment on Catholic Web sites.</p>
<p>America, a weekly run by the Jesuit order of priests, said in a statement it was embarrassed and offended by the ad, which it said had been published unknowingly in its December 5 edition.</p>
<p>The apparent prank by a London-based artist offered what he called the "Extra Virgin" statue for sale, "a stunning ... statue of the Virgin Mary standing atop a serpent wearing a delicate veil of latex."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Naturally, the Jesuit priests are both embarrassed (which we all can understand) <em>and</em> offended by the ad. After all, what person in our society today <em>isn't</em> de rigeur offended by absolutely everything they remotely disagree with? </p>
<p>On the other hand, could someone explain why the Virgin Mary using a condom would make her "extra" virgin? Cavalierly brandishing a flaccid condom about, at the very least, usually implies a healthy menu of carnal penetration... a course pretty much the anti-thesis of plain old virginity, let alone "extra" virginity.</p>
