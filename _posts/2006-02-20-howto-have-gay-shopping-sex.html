<p>Homo and horny and shopping in Cleveland? Check out the Westgate mall<br />
s second floor toilet in Kohl<br />

...I went into a stall on a Sunday afternoon. I was stroking my cock and in less than two minutes a guy came into the stall next to mine and tapped his foot on my side of the stall. I then knelt down on the floor sliding my cock in his end of the stall. He sucked me off fast and hard! It was one of the most exciting blowjobs I have ever had!</p>
<p>Here's some <a href="http://www.google.com/local?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&rls=GGGL,GGGL:2005-09,GGGL:en&q=kohl%27s&near=Cleveland,+OH&sa=X&oi=locald&radius=0.0&latlng=41499444,-81695556,6065264906173499179">directions</a> to the store.</p>
<p>And at one Arizona Walmart, it<br />
s not just the worker<br />
s wages that are going down...</p>
<p>
I run cattle and I'm through this area frequently and I am in Wal-Mart frequently. Every single time I've been there I've gotten a blowjob by young cute guys in the evenings. Keep it up. It's like home away from home,<br />
 writes one visitor to the Walmart on <a href="http://www.google.com/local?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=walmart&near=Show+Low,+AZ&latlng=34254167,-110029167,6722648072598054991">White Mountain Blvd in Show Low, AZ</a>.</p>
<p>Aimee H. <a href="http://www.insiderpages.com/profiles/WalMartSupercenter-kpt_7qDNTUa2irsTimhH3w/">reports</a> that this Walmart is indeed, "...SO busy! It is a turnoff from the beginning. The employees are SO overworked and can't offer much help."</p>
<p>Must be all that sucking off.</p>
