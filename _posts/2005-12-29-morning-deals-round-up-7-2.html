excerpt: "â€¢ Radio Shack has a 30% coupon that works online for some items We can't
  tell you what, exactly, because we're as lazy as the day is long and we try not
  to ever shop at Rat Shack unless we have to. But they carry some products from solid
  brands like Logitech and iRiver, so give ol' code RS30 a try. [via Slickdeals"

<p>&bull; It's a rebate deal, so we apologize, but you can get the Kingston Elite Pro 2GB CompactFlash memory card <a href="http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=10390647&adid=17662">for $90 after $20 rebate</a> at Buy.com, which is a fine price for a fine card.

<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a>: Is sold out. It was a keyboard bundle with a headset.</p>
