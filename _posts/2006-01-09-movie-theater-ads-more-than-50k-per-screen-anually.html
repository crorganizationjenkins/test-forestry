<p>There's not a <i>ton</i> of new information in Ars Technica's <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060105-5905.html">Peek into movie theater economics</a>, but Ken Fisher does manage to pull out a few bits that were new to us.</p>
<p>Did you know, for instance, that the pre-movie advertisements&mdash;now running up to fifteen minutes before showtime&mdash;come at the expense of movie trailers? The studios don't actually pay to get their advertisements for future films on screen, meaning they essentially have to beg to get their full run of movie previews instead of another ad for your local community college.</p>
<p>Considering how much we despise the movie industry, though, we're not sure if we should be pitying anyone, besides those who actually paid to watch a movie.</p>
