<p>Buy early, buy again&mdash;because the first model always sucks. If you couldn't resist the lure of Microsoft's new Xbox 360 game console, do yourself a favor and <a href="http://www.llamma.com/xbox360/news/Xbox-360-Game-Disc-Scratched.htm">don't move it while it's on</a>. Even though a selling point of the new console is that it can be oriented either horizontally or vertically, turning it from one position to the other while it is on will cause the game disc inside to be gouged. Big scratches on your new $60 game and the smell of burnt plastic. Is it Christmas already?</p>
<p>Llama.com even has a movie showing the <a href="http://dwl.xbox-scene.com/video/Xbox-360-Scratch-Disks3.wmv">scratching in action</a>. [1.5MB WMV]</p>
