excerpt: 'We know that when we linked the story about the Prada store burning down,
  our astute readership recognized the post for what it was: shameless quota-meeting
  filler on a slow news day. "So Paris Hilton has one less ten thousand dollar handbagâ€”how
  does that affect me, Joe or Jane America?" you might have asked yourself, depending
  on the configuration of your genitals or gender image. We admit, it wasn''t much
  of a story, and we''re sorry to have wasted your time with it. To use the parlance
  of consumerism, it added little take home.'

<p>We know that when we linked the story about <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/shopping/soho-fire-ruins-millions-in-prada-150026.php">the Prada store burning down</a>, our astute readership recognized the post for what it was: shameless quota-meeting filler on a slow news day. "So Paris Hilton has one less ten thousand dollar handbag&mdash;how does that affect me, Joe or Jane America?" you might have asked yourself, depending on the configuration of your genitals or gender image. We admit, it wasn't much of a story, and we're sorry to have wasted your time with it. To use the parlance of consumerism, it added little <i>take home</i>.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=122502">But this story is different.</a> Yes, another retail outlet has burned down, but this time, it's a retail outlet that actually matters. First of all, it's a <em>porn</em> store that burned down. And second of all, it's not <em>a</em> porn store that turned down... it's <em>two</em>. And third of all, it's not two porn stores that burned down... it's two porn stores that are so amazing that they actually have the adjective right in their title!<br />
<blockquote>For the second time in less than a week, an Amazing porn shop north of Boston has burned to ashes, too hot for even firefighters to handle.</p></blockquote>
<p>The chain of sizzling sex toy and va-va-voom video superstores, where fans frolic with their favorite X-rated stars, may be victims of nothing more than bad luck.</p>
<p>
I<br />
ve been in this job long enough to know there are times when there are coincidences,<br />
 state Fire Marshal Stephen Coan said yesterday after the Amazing Superstore on Route 1 north in Peabody went up in smoke less than 12 miles from where, on Jan. 16, fire reduced the Amazing video store on Main Street in Reading to rubble. </p>
<p>Isn't that second sentence just great? We also love the panicked response from the fire chief when asked the most pertinent question: for god's sakes, man, can any of the porn be saved?<br />
<blockquote>Asked if rescue crews were able to save any Amazing merchandise, Coughlin said,<br />
I was never a customer, so I don<br />
t know what would have been worth salvaging. But, there was nothing left. Everything was incinerated.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That's the sort of overexplained sound byte that only a man afraid his wife is watching him on television at home would give. </p>
