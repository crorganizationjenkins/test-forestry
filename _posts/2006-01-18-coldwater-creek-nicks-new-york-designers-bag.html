<p>Neal Decker is a handbag designer in New York. After seeing our story about <a href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/evil/urban-outfitters-rips-designers-cupcake-tshirt-149095.php">Urban Outfitters ripping off small designers</a>, he wrote in with his own experiences with big-brand boning:</p>
<p><i>am a bag designer in NYC (www.nealdecker.com) and a few years ago the cheesy knock off house Coldwater Creek kept a few of my designs for a suspiciously long time. They never placed an order, but completely<br />
knocked off my tote.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://nealdecker.com/press.php?pressId=3">Neal's design</a> is on the left, while <a href="http://www.coldwatercreek.com/aspx/product.aspx?np=true&channel=2&productId=20758&deptId=40&ensembleId=21553">Coldwater Creek's</a> is on the right. They do look nearly identical&mdash;right down to the flower treament.</p>
