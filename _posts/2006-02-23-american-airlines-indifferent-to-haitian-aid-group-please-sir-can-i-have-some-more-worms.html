<p>A humanitarian aid group en route to Haiti suffered from a scheduling change made by American Airlines and had to pay $450 in hotel bills. American Airlines (AA) refused to offer hotel vouchers in return. </p>
<p>
That's just the way it is, that's our policy," said Mary Francis Fagan, American Airlines spokesperson, to a Chicago Tribune reporter.</p>
<p>"It's hard, because all of us keep putting our money in, and we're like, man, this could go to a much better purpose," Sue Walsh, the volunteer group<br />
s organizer said. "That would be a lot of X-rays and a lot of lab work."</p>
<p>The eleven-person group planned to visit the beleaguered island to deworm children and provide vitamins to the malnutrition-suffering.</p>
<p>To AA's credit, they did inform the group's travel agent, Capital One, of the scheduling change. Capital One okayed it. It's AA's policy only to distribute vouchers if there's a mechanical failure, said Fagan. The trip could also have been cancelled for a full refund.</p>
<p>Incidentally, "Fagin" is the name of the master pickpocket and thug in <em>Oliver Twist</em>, wherein Dickens describes him as a<br />
loathsome reptile<br />
 and having<br />
fangs such as should have been a dog<br />
s or rat<br />
