<p>&bull; <a href="http://slickdeals.net">SlickDeals</a> is reporting that the <a href="http://www.officemax.com/max/solutions/product/prodBlock.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=no&prodBlockOID=1611233467&cm_ven=Performics&cm_cat=%2A%2ASlick%20Deals%2A%2A&cm_pla=Primary&cm_ite=Primary&BV_UseBVCookie=no&affCode=PRF&siteID=k1971&mid=">Sony DSC-S40 4.1-megapixel camera</a> is going for a $100, in store only. Yes, that would be a good deal.</p>
<p>&bull; Although potentially a freebie, it's more likely that you'll be winning coupons for Dell televisions by playing the <a href="http://dell.eprize.net/tv/index.tbapp?page=prereg_form&affiliate_id=1b">Dell TV Big Game</a>, uh, Game, than winning a free flat-screen TV. [via <a href="http://techbargains.com">TechBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; It's no iPod, but if you're more into cheap music listening, Philips' Outlet has the <a href="http://www.outlet.philips.com/b2c_redesign/b2c/productdetail.do?productguid=4191384020DB008D00000000828BD47242A6C8E12979034100000000828BD443&productarea=4191384020DB008D00000000828BD472&scenario=catalog&shop=OUTLET">HDD075 2GB Mini Audio Jukebox</a> refurbished for $70 plus shipping.</p>
<p>&bull; If you want to dabble in front projection but don't like putting systems together piece-by-piece, this <a href="http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=202154584&adid=17662">bundle from Buy.com</a> includes an Optoma MovieTime DV10 DLP projector with a built-in DVD player, a bundled subwoofer, and the high-gain Panoview GreyWolf glass-beaded screen for $1,300, shipped. One could work out a better deal overall, but if you just want to want DVDs on a big screen, all of these components are capable. [via <a href="http://bensbargains.net">BensBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; JetBlue wants you to get out of the house with their 'Winter Clearance Sale,' including flights to the Bahamas and Dominican Republic for just $80 each way from New York. <a href="http://www.fodors.com/wire/archives/001477.cfm">Fodor's</a> has a list of flights from JFK and Newark, but it looks like it might be easier just to use <a href="http://www.jetblue.com/specialoffers/superfly.asp">JetBlue's sale page</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; Today's Woot! The refurbished <a href="http://woot.com">JVC Compact Mini DV Camcorder</a> (Model GR-D250US) for just $205, shipped. New, these usually go for about $275.</p>
