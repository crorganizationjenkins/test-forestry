excerpt: Friends of ours have been charged way more than usual for car rides to and
  from work in New York today, never once having left the zone. We were under the
  impression that the livery rules also applied to hired car services? Are we just
  wrong?

<p>Friends of ours have been charged way more than usual for car rides to and from work in New York today, never once having left the zone. We were under the impression that the <a href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/deals/taxi-and-livery-vehicle-rules-updated-for-strike-144171.php">livery rules</a> also applied to hired car services? Are we just wrong?</p>
<p><i>Update: 311 says car services aren't livery services. We say the dictionary is a commie.</i></p>
