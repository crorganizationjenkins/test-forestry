<p>Northwest Airlines is rolling out a program to charge  a bit more for extra stretch space.</p>
<p>The airline plans on giving travellers the option to pay $15 more and upgrade to an aisle or emergency exit seat. Such a seat can offer up to ten inches extra. Only about 5% of the seats on the domestic flights will go up for sale in this manner as the airline gauges consumer response. </p>
<p>If the program is a success, we could see other airlines following suit and then everyone can eat a $5 bag of pretzels in a $15 exit row chair while sipping a $6 can of Pepsi and enduring the joy of $2 customer service.</p>
<p>What happens when the flight is so booked you've got a guy who just paid 15 bucks to upsize sitting across the aisle from a guy who's sitting pretty at the standard fare? Hilarity? Anger? Sadness? Fear? Delusions of Grandeur?</p>
