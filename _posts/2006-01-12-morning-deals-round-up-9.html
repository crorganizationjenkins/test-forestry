<p>&bull; If all the goofy Hot Coffee controversy didn't inspire you to play <i>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</i> in one of its two versions on the Playstation 2, Best Buy is taking orders for the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?categoryid=cat02121&id=1122655461192&skuid=7426546&type=product&ref=&loc=">Xbox version for only $20</a>. Ships in mid-February. [via <a href="http://techbargains.com">TechBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Dell has extended their point-and-shoot camera sale for another day, with discounts in the 15 to 20% range. Ben's Bargains has a <a href="http://www.bensbargains.net/ktalk/1137052875,23200,.shtml">thorough</a> index of cameras available with pre- and post-discount prices.</p>
