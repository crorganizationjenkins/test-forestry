<p>Here's a spoof of Citibank's hoary "Live Richly" ad campaign, penned by Adfreak's Tim Nudd. </p>
<p>As he <a href="http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/2006/03/does_citibank_s.html">points out</a>, the long burner is ripe for a fall with its insouciant counterintuitive position. </p>
<p>When you're rolling down 6th in your Bentley fueled by liquefied $1000 bills, it's truly the little things that matter. Like whether your diamond-studded pocket-rocket has full batteries (also coated in diamonds). </p>
<p>Let's get Farked! Add your own "Live Poorly" spoofs in the comments and if they're awesome, we'll mock 'em up and post 'em. </p>
<p>A great way to vent about Citibank locking you out of your ATM account and not telling you about it.</p>
