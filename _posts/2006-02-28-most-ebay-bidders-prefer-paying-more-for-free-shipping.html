<p>A new study shows that most Ebay shoppers would rather pay less and pay for shipping than pay more and have free shipping.</p>
<p>80 auctions of new CD's and Xbox games were held. Opening bid prices and shipping costs were manipulated on identical titles.</p>
<p>The researchers found that lowering the opening bid while raising shipping costs attracted more bidders faster and generated higher profits than the reverse.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/ebay.pdf">pdf</a> of the research results.</p>
<p>Let the buyer beware, of himself?</p>
