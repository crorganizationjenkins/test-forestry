<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/bmw.jpg"></a>BMW's probably feeling pretty conflicted about this story about a British man who crashed his Beamer.</p>
<p>On one hand, it doesn't speak very well for high German craftsmanship when one of your customers finds his accelerator pedal jammed and smashes into a roundabout at 135mph.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it speaks <em>extremely</em> well for high German craftsmanship that said podge-eyed, brown-toothed Brit walked away from a 135mph collision with a solid object completely uninjured.</p>
