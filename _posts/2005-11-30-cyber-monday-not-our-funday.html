excerpt: 'Business Week''s Bob D. Hof has a brilliant dissection of the ''Cyber Monday''
  campaign, the much-touted farce designed by Shop.org to spur you to purchase lots
  of holiday crap.Shop.org member Shmuel Gniwisch, chief executive of the online jewelry
  site Ice.com, recalls getting an e-mail from Shop.org last year, suggesting that
  online retailers come up with their own marketing hook to match Black Friday. "The
  online guys got together and said, ''Let''s give people something different,''"
  he says. "The reality is, we didn''t notice anything special" on the Monday after
  Thanksgiving.We''ve personally gotten dozens of calls about ''Cyber Monday'' over
  the last week, mostly from confused print and television editors questioning why
  they hadn''t heard of this massive online retail fiesta. The reason is pretty clear,
  as Hof explains: for most major online retailers, ''Cyber Monday'' isn''t the biggest
  shopping day of the year.'
