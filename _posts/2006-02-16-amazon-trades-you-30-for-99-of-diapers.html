<p>Until Feb. 28 you can get a $30 Amazon.com gift certificate after making a $99-and-up Amazon.com order of Huggies brand products. </p>
<p>Last November the online superstore did the same, except the minimum order was $79. </p>
<p>Which, as Greg Allen of Daddytypes.com pointed out to us, makes one feel like<br />
Pavlov's dog, being conditioned to order a garageful of diapers one month, then a $31 stack of DVD's the next.
 </p>
<p>Yes, back in Pavlov<br />
s day before Amazon.com little Fido sure ran up a high Blockbuster bill.</p>
