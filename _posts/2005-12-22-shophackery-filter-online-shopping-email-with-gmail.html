excerpt: 'Here''s a cool bit of shophackery: If you append a descriptor to the end
  of your Gmail name—say, consumerist+shopping@gmail.com, instead of consumerist@gmail.com—you
  can then add a filter to Gmail to catch all those emails. That allows you to filter
  out your potentially spammy online shopping mail using the same account.'

<p>Here's a cool bit of shophackery: If you append a descriptor to the end of your Gmail name&mdash;say, consumerist+shopping@gmail.com, instead of consumerist@gmail.com&mdash;you can then add a filter to Gmail to catch all those emails. That allows you to filter out your potentially spammy online shopping mail using the same account.</p>
<p>One could even get more granular and create a filter for each online store, like '+Amazon,' or create a test filter for a unknown company to see if they're sending you spam, like '+spamtest.' It should work pretty well until the spammers start cleaning off anything with the +.</p>
<p>Of course, we weren't smart enough to figure this out on our own. Get even more knowledge at <a href="http://blog.kevingunn.org/archives/2005/12/sorting_your_em.html">Kevin Gunn's site</a>.</p>
