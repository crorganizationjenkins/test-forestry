<p>A <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/howto/howto-buy-a-laptop-on-ebay-156227.php">HOWTO on laptop buying</a> should be followed up by a HOWNOTTO. Patricia McGehee bought a "high gaming" laptop for $2000 from the "<a href="http://www.uniwill.com">Uniwill Corporation</a>." She wants to play chess games and found the computer powers down after a CD is inserted. </p>
<p>Contractually, she's supposed to have on-site service but it's been entirely unforthcoming. She<br />
s left dozens of unreturned messages. After finally piercing through and shipping her laptop for repair, it was sent back in exactly the same condition. </p>
<p>Does anyone have any advice for Patricia on forcing a company to live up to its warranty?</p>
