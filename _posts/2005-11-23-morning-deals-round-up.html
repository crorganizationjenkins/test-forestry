excerpt: "â€¢ Enjoy yourself some Dell Game, wherein you may be creeped out by an overzealous
  elf and click to win prizes. Of course, you're probably going to win bupkiss, but
  when you play the 'Pick a Stocking' game you'll receive a coupon code in consolation.
  And you can play until the end of the Holidays."

<p>&bull; Enjoy yourself some <a href="http://dell.eprize.net/regifting">Dell Game</a>, wherein you may be creeped out by an overzealous elf and click to win prizes. Of course, you're probably going to win bupkiss, but when you play the 'Pick a Stocking' game you'll receive a coupon code in consolation. And you can play until the end of the Holidays.</p>

<p>&bull; We're not much on what brands of blue jeans are popular these days (for you, we're willing to learn). But it doesn't take a PhD in Z. Cavaricci to know that jeans that normally sold for $150&mdash;we're talking about '7 for All Mankind,' here&mdash;now going for $50 or so is hot. Unless the brand is now lame and we're steering you towards certain choadiness. <a href="http://www.scoopnyc.com/jump.jsp?itemType=CATEGORY&itemID=139&path=1%2C2%2C411%2C126%2C139">ScoopNYC</a> via, inexplicably, <a href="http://techbargains.com">TechBargains</a></p>
<p>&bull; The 1.5GHz Apple Powerbook may be the last 12-inch Powerbook for a while (rumors say the new Intel ones will just be 15- and 17-inch). Whatever the case, this new after-rebate price on Amazon is solid: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007KX4WO/102-0392434-9450502?v=glance&n=541966">$1,250</a>.</p>
