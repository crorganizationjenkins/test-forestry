excerpt: Slightly old news, but the stone-faced-stand-off-to-first-blink between Blackberry
  maker Research in Motion (RIM) and NTP over vague patents to send email from portable

Which is great news for the consumers who've been nervously caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p>RIM agreed to pay NTP $612.5 million in a settlement, after Judge James Spencer threw a righteous cow over the absolute juvenility of the entire dispute.</p>
<p>NTP, weeping the tears of martyrs all the way to the bank, have gone on record as stating they aren't happy with the settlement but will stoically cry themselves to sleep on beds made of money for the good of the nation.</p>
