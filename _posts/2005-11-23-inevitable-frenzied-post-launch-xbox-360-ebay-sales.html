excerpt: If we figure that the lowest average price for an Xbox 360 Premium kit is
  around $450ish after tax, the going rate on Ebay this morning would seem to be around
  $945â€”nearly double the retail price. That's not a bad bit of profit for anyone who
  could get their hands on a system, let alone three or four.

<p>If we figure that the lowest average price for an Xbox 360 Premium kit is around $450ish after tax, the <a href="http://search.ebay.com/xbox-360_W0QQfromZR40">going rate on Ebay</a> this morning would seem to be around $945&mdash;nearly double the retail price. That's not a bad bit of profit for anyone who could get their hands on a system, let alone three or four.</p>
<p>Before you thaw the credit card, though, bear in mind that Microsoft has said to expect new shipments of consoles almost daily through Christmas. Conversely, also read <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051122-5609.html">speculative reports</a> claiming all Xbox 360s are sold out through February of next year.</p>
<p>If you must indeed get Junior a new gaming console this year (or, as we would advise, giving Junior 360 milligrams of Phenobarbital and keeping the console for yourself), take this bit of hollow advice: no matter where you get the 360 in the end, start buying the games and peripherals you want <i>now</i>, while they are in thick supply.</p>
