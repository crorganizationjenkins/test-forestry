<li>Media convergence, not muskets, will <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/200602/22/eng20060222_244785.html">fight</a> piracy. This guy knows his piracy, he's from China.</p>

<p /></li>
<li>UK-counter pirate vows to catch crooks giving away free copies of Firefox. You have to admire <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9075-2051196,00.html">her dedication</a>.
<p /></li>
<li>One for each day of the week, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/23/7_new_mpaa_lawsuits_.html">7 new MPAA lawsuits</a>.
<p /></li>
<li>'How the US is <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004434.php">Boning</a> the Developing World' by whittling the public domain. If you're not using your copyrights, send them to a starving African child. Just one trademark a day can feed an entire village for weeks.
<p /></li>
<li>There was an <a href="http://freeculture.sccs.swarthmore.edu/?p=31">anti-DRM protest</a> last Saturday at a Tower Records in Philly. We didn't go. Heard that our plans to split cheese steaks amongst friends wouldn't constitute 'fair use.'</li>
</ul>
