<p>&bull; H&R Block is giving away free copies of their <a href="http://www.hrblock.com/assets/partners/dpro_giveaway.html">DeductionPro software</a>, which we've been told is normally a $20 upgrade ot thier TaxCut software. (Although it works in a standalone mode, as well.) [via <a href="http://slickdeals.net">Slickdeals</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon has the ironically-named <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B18P96/ref=nosim/102-0392434-9450502?n=284507">Back to Basics TEM500 Egg & Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher</a> for $40 with free shipping. This is a so-so deal, but we got one for Christmas and have been utterly entraced at its redundancy.</p>
<p>&bull; Dell Home is selling the <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?sku=A0488055&cs=19&c=us&l=en">Olympus IR-500 4MP 2.8x Zoom Camera</a> for $159.20, after you apply the coupon code: <b>PSVPPT40QDS3W0</b>.</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://www.woot.com/">Woot!</a> is the Boston Acoustics 5-Piece Speaker System for $65, shipped. '5-Piece' means it's technically a 4.1 system (no center channel), but if you've been longing for a bit of surround for your PC, they might not be a bad deal. They don't sell for too much more on Amazon, but they did review very well&mdash;in 2002.</p>
