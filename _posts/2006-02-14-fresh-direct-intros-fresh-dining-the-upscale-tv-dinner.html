Lazy New Yorkers will hearten to hear that everyone<br />
s favorite way of avoiding interacting with people poorer than you, the Fresh Direct food delivery service, has introduced Fresh Dining. </p>
<p>There<br />
s Fresh Dining Chicken Teriyaki, Fresh Dining Provencal Tilapia and Fresh Dining Dill-Lemon Salmon, and more, a veritable cornucopia to delight your monocled sloth palate.</p>
<p>Like its forerunner, <a href="http://www.freshdirect.com/category.jsp?catId=hmr_fresh&trk=dpage">Fresh Dining</a> delivers to Manhattan and the surrounding urbopolis. There's a $40 minimum order and a delivery fee of $4.95 that increases as you spiral outwards from the emerald city.</p>
<p>We're holding out for Fresh Feeding where the immigrant workers will actually airplane shrimp marinara into our waiting maw.</p>
