Buy a warranty on a new, untested, fragile, break-prone technology,<br />
 writes in Consumerist tipster Zoe,<br />
and you could find yourself essentially leasing the newest, sexiest gadget every nine months for the rest of your life.<br />
 While hardly a revelation, it's nice to see some areas where the customer still has the upper hand.</p>
<p>Four years ago she bought two Creative Zen 40GBs for under $300 apiece, along with a 2-year Replacement Plan for $40.</p>
<p>Both players broke, from the same faulty headphone jack. She mailed the player to Best Buy who sent her back a voucher for the full amount. </p>
<p>This time she got a Rio and a new two-year plan. In due course, the player's hard drive failed. </p>
<p>She handed it in and "grudgingly" settled on a fourth-generation iPod which lasted for 18 months until the battery life<br />
went south and the click wheel stopped responding.</p>
<p>Yesterday she took the iPod in to a Best Buy and got herself a new one with a fresh warranty.</p>
<blockquote><p></p>
<p>And wouldn't you know it, but they play video now!</p></blockquote>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Zoe</p>
<p>Readers, have you ridden the same warranty train for other sexy widgets?</p>
