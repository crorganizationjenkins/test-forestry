<p>David Edmonson stepped down yesterday as CEO of Radio Shack. </p>
<p>Only days ago he said he would stay on, even after he admitted to claiming two degrees on his resume when he really had zero.</p>
<p>For his troubles, Edmonson received something less than $1 million in severance pay.</p>
<p>"When our company's credibility becomes based on a single individual, it is time for a change," announced Leonard H. Roberts, the company's executive chairman, who chose Mr. Edmondson as his successor as CEO, "One of the most important things we have as a corporation is integrity and trust. We have to restore that back to the company."</p>
<p>As of yesterday, all of the company's officers biographies, which included their degree record, have been removed and <a href="http://www.radioshackcorporation.com/media/execbios.html">replaced with the statement</a>, "We are currently updating and validating all of the biographical information for each of our senior executives. Please check back soon to receive this information." [archival pic <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/radioshackcorp.jpg">here</a>]</p>
