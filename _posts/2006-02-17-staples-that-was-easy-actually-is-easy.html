excerpt: In a complete break of character, we present a short tale of a shoddy chair,
  a friendly Staples customer service representative and a no-hassle return policy
  faithfully executed. Shangri-la and the groove of one man's beautiful behind, after
  the jump.

<p>Cap writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>
Back in January I received a new chair as a Christmas gift.  For a short period of time, my butt was in heaven - it was one happy camper.</p>
<p>Now I<br />
m not a heavy person, but within a one month period, the seat cushion has somehow magically disappeared. Evaporated, per se. The only thing left behind is the groove of my beautiful behind.</p>
<p>Needless to say, when it comes to the welfare of my butt, I take immediate and prompt action! So, a few days later I called the customer service included with the warranty card, and told them my woes.</p>
<p>The CSR asked for the model number, my name and address.</p>
<p>
Okay sir, we<br />
ll be sending you a new seat cushion. You<br />
ll receive it in about 7 to 10 business days.</p>
<p>
Uh, okay. Thanks!</p>
<p>That was easy.</p>
<p>No proof of order, silly red tape, or transferring of calls. I<br />
m pleasantly surprised and confused.</p>
<p>Being the pessistimic person that I am, I now believed that I have been tricked and that the CSR was only pretend to be typing down my information.</p>
<p>Guess I<br />
ll find out in 7-10 business days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could be snarky and say let's see if the seat doesn't get pulled out from him in a week, but you know what? We have a feeling this one's going to be alright.</p>
