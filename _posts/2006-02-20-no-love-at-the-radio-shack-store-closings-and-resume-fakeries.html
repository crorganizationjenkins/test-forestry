<p>400-700 Radio Shack stores will close this year, announced Radio Shack<br />
s besieged CEO Dave Edmonson on Friday. The company operates 7,000 stores, all of which need your zip code to sell you batteries.</p>
<p>2005 earnings were substantially below Wall Street expectations.</p>
<p>It came to light last week that the CEO may have lied on his resume about having a degree. He claimed two, one in psychology and one in theology, from an unaccredited Bible school. The school has never offered a degree in psychology. He said the other degree burned in a garage fire, perhaps while attempting unaccredited rituals.</p>
<p>The Radio Shack board initially said it would stand by Edmonson. Wednesday the board announced plans to hire a law firm to investigate the matter. </p>
<p>Investigate or cover up?</p>
<p>We once needed to convert RCA video signal to S-Video and they tried to sell us a whole honkin' multi-channel video switch apparatchik. Thing was, the S-Video and RCA were on the same side. After pointing out there was no way to route the signal like they described, they finally produced the necessary $25 double-mouthed video connector.</p>
<p>While the resume flap is disappointing, is Radio Shack and its lackadaisical customer service even frickin' relevant anymore?</p>
