<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/airplane.jpg"></a>The Department of Transportation<br />
s (DOT) released its scintillating<br />
Air Travel Consumer Report,<br />
 revealing intriguing trends in the various ways airlines screwed up last year. </p>
<p>Consumers registered 13 discrimination complaints, the same as 2004. Are carriers applying the same stringent levels of racism or are these just the same 13 people that they don't like? </p>
<p>Topping the complaint chart is baggage. Unfortunately, there<br />
s no breakout as to percentage related to indelicately handled not-my-vibrator incidences. </p>
<p>The most complaints were for American Airlines. Comair, Independence Air and Trans States Air received the least, mainly because no one flies them. </p>
<p>The DOT also informs that<br />
on-time<br />
 means anything less than 15 minutes late. Note too the section on "Customer Service Reports to the Department of Homeland Security."</p>
<p>The report would<br />
ve been great at the crack of Monday while <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/complaints/consumers-speak-jetblues-boston-boomerang-154351.php">stuck</a> on Jetblueballs. We could<br />
ve used it to lodge a complaint right up the fascist stewardess<br />
s rear cabin.</p>
