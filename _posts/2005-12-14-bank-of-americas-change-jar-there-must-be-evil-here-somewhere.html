excerpt: 'Since we''ve spent a large portion of our day tearing at Bank of America,
  we thought we''d offer this recommendation for a new savings program, sent in by
  (probably astroturf) reader Greg. It seems Bank of America has a new program that
  rounds up your debit charges to the nearest dollar, then puts the change in a savings
  account. Gamey, but we like it.But here''s the interesting part: for the first 3
  months they''ll match it up to $250. So if you rack up $250 or more in change over
  3 months, BofA will give you $250. After 3 months, they''ll continue to match but
  only at 5%.'

<p>Anyways, I know go out of my way to rack up purchases that end in a few pennies.<br />
 $11.01 at the gas pump, perfect.<br />
 $45.32 bill at a restaurant, hmm how about a $8.69 tip for total of $54.01.</p>
<p>I haven't gone as far as sending myself PayPal invoices for a penny, but the thought has crossed my mind.</p>
