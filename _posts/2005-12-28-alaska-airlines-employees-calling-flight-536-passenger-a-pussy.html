excerpt: So we've probably all heard about the Alaska Airlines Flight 536 de-pressurization,
  which forced them to land (safely) because of a pesky hole in the side of the jet.
  Jeremy Hermanns definitely heard about it, because he was on the plane, taking pictures
  and movies with his Treo. (Which, incidentally, nice PR moment, Palm. We'll expect
  the "Dying? Share it with Treo" ads soon.)

<p>So we've probably all heard about the Alaska Airlines Flight 536 de-pressurization, which forced them to land (safely) because of a pesky hole in the side of the jet. Jeremy Hermanns <i>definitely</i> heard about it, because he was <a href="http://jeremyhermanns.org/me/alaska-flight-536-rapid-de-pressurization-and-panic-at-30k-feet/">on the plane</a>, taking pictures and movies with his Treo. (Which, incidentally, nice PR moment, Palm. We'll expect the "Dying? Share it with <i>Treo</i>" ads soon.)</p>
<p>Here's where we come in: Jeremy's blog has been slammed with comments, some of which appear to be from <a href="http://jeremyhermanns.org/me/alaska-airlines-comments-on-my-story/">Alaska Airlines employees themselves</a>. While we encourage the Alaska Airlines employees to get all PR 2.0 and transparent and stuff, we really don't think employees should tell a customer who nearly fell out of their airplane at thirty thousand feet that he's a "pussy."</p>
<p>Maybe we're too sensitive about near-death&mdash;or as we call them, 'lawsuity'&mdash;experiences. Alaska Airlines should be offering Hermanns a double-strength apology with terminal velocity.</p>
