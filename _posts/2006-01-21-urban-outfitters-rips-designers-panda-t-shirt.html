<p>Just this evening, my friends told me that they saw <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/images/us/local/products/productsall/p220085c.jpg">a t-shirt on Urban Outfitters</a> that looked eerily like <a href="http://www.madapollam.com/Madapollam.com/pandamodelpic.jpg">one of mine</a>.</p>
<p>I checked it out. I can't imagine that they didn't rip their idea from me.</p>
<p>It's too bad that my original artwork is not going to reach the thousands of people who may end up buying that Urban Outfitters shirt - just some lame-o immitation.Molly's shirt is on the left, UO's on the right.</p>
