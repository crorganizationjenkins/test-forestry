<p>
A coterie of San Francisco residents who vowed not to buy anything new in 2006 have been<br />
staggered<br />
 by the international response.</p>
<p>The Compact, named after the Mayflower pilgrims' credo, consists of about 50 people who decided to go a year without buying anything besides food, health, safety items, and clean underwear.</p>
<p>Since their story appeared last Monday, the group has been besieged with emails and media inquiries. Over 350 have joined and chapters are springing up in<br />
nearly every<br />
 US city as well as international locations.</p>
<p>Attention has been both positive and negative.</p>
<p>"I've also been attacked personally for being in marketing," said Perry, "One person said that's like a pimp preaching abstinence. Then someone else said it was like a sinner seeking penitence -- who better?"</p>
<p>Bear in mind the looseness of the affiliation. To join Compact, you need only sign up for their Yahoogroup. </p>
<p>Pictured is John Perry, a member of Compact, and his son, shopping at a San Fran scrap yard. Perry only buys secondhand but still manages to look like Steven Colbert<br />
s hip technician older brother.</p>
