<p>Everyone's all about the Razr's "cutting edge" HAR HAR HAR super-thin construction but it looks like they might've left something out in the design, as glitches are causing phonecalls to drop.</p>
<p>Motorala says the problem only affects a small number of phones but Cingular and T-Mobile have pulled the units from their shelves as of Thursday.</p>
<p>"In the problem Razrs, a component was misreading the phone as closed when it was flipped open, cutting off calls."</p>
<p>"The glitch does not affect Razrs sold through Verizon Wireless, because Verizon uses a different [ie slightly less sucky] wireless technology than Cingular and T-Mobile."</p>
<p>UPDATE: A reader writes in to say they've been experiencing the same issue since October 1st, which is earlier than the February posted being the defect date.</p>
