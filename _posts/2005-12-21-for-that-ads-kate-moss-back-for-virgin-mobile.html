<p>Lady Kate 'Coco' Moss is back on the spokesmodel tip, with this new spot for Virgin Mobile.</p>
<p>We like it. Taking a shot at oneself is an age-old public relations trick, but in this age of obstinacy in the face of guilt, we still dig it.</p>
<p>Enjoy to watch on our sister site Gawker, which was figured out how to embed YouTube videos on the site. We need to figure that out post haste, so as to make more of these softball posts.</p>
