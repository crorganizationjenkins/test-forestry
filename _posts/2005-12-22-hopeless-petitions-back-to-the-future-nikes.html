excerpt: We know the chances of this actually working are slim-to-none, but as burgeoning
  sneaker junky, we've got to mention it. Someone has created an online petition requesting
  that Nike create the future high-tops worn by Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future
  II. They look strangely hip these days, and it's actually possible to affordably
  recreate the glowing Nike logo from the movie. (The powered lacing might be a little
  bit more difficult, but it's probably not unpossible, either.)

<p>We know the chances of this actually working are slim-to-none, but as burgeoning sneaker junky, we've got to mention it. Someone has created an <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/future2/petition.html">online petition</a> requesting that Nike create the future high-tops worn by Michael J. Fox in <i>Back to the Future II</i>. They look strangely hip these days, and it's actually possible to affordably recreate the glowing Nike logo from the movie. (The powered lacing might be a little bit more difficult, but it's probably not unpossible, either.)</p>
<p>So that leads to a natural question: What products, created by the movie industry at the behest of paying corporations, would you actually like to see produced? And does seeing a company's brand extrapolated to the future make it seem cooler or somehow cheapen it?</p>
