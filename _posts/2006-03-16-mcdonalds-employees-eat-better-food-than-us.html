excerpt: McDonald's employees, tired of eating the nigh-inedible offal which they
  slop out to customers day after day, have formed a Livejournal community dedicated
  to sharing with one another the culinary delights they have created for themselves
  with McDonald's ingredients in a McDonald's kitchen. Amazingly, a lot of it looks
  pretty good...

<p><em>Barbecue Tortilla Pizza - Two tortilla shells, two 10:1 patties, chopped, one packet Barbecue sauce, diced tomatoes, slivered onions, green peppers, shredded Montery/Cheddar cheese. Using some of the cheese, place in between two tortilla shells on a parchment lined pie pan. Using a sundae spoon, coat the tortilla with barbecue sauce (may use more than one packet if desired). Top with meat, then vegetables, then remainder of cheese. Cook under 'Ready Baked Biscuit' (9min) or 'Baked Pie' (12min).</em></p>
<p>Heck, we'd eat that, although we're not quite sure about the Pregnant Craving Special. Of course, don't expect anything as edible-looking as a Barbecue Tortilla Pizza to appear at a McDonald's near you anytime soon. Still, we're tempted to print off some of these recipes and see if enough counter fist-pounding and apoplectic seizures will get the McDonald's around the corner to make us one of these.</p>
