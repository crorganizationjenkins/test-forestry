<p>Jessica Coen, one of our chaste sisters kept cloistered in an attic room over at <a href="http://www.gawker.com/">Gawker.com</a>, had a very strong reaction to our <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/catalogue-reviews/we-take-the-ikea-catalogue-to-the-bathroom-and-lock-the-door-158055.php">IKEA catalogue review</a>. To wit:</p>

Maybe <em>The Consumerist</em> can sponsor a IKEA catalogue reading slumber party. </p>
