Scoring consumer tech bargains has gotten harder but are still there for the savy, reports The New York Times. </p>
<p>Due to innovations like supply-chain management and just-in-time production, "there are fewer Oh-my-god bargains," said Ron Boire, executive vice president and general merchandise manager for Best Buy, "but now all customers are getting a good price instead of a few customers getting a great price."</p>
<p>To get a good deal, be patient, diligent and avoid impulse buying.  The old grey lady (that<br />
s how cool media types refer to the NYT) advises watching Gizmodo, Engadget, News.com and Twice.com. Also, use NexTag to monitor price history charts.</p>
<p>
A constantly downward sloping line suggests that the manufacturer has control of inventory and prices are dropping at a natural "electronics just get cheaper" pace. That means there's not much you can do. Anything you buy will be cheaper a month from now. But a flat line that also shows some abrupt drops, however small, suggests a struggling product. A need to outflank a competitor with price promotions or trim growing inventories can cause that pattern. If the line is flat for a while, hold off buying. It will drop soon enough. It always does,<br />
 informs the article.</p>
<p>Then you can be smiling like hip Minnesota Best Buyer shopper, Dilya Gumerova (pictured). Happiness is a warm cathode-ray tube, newly purchased and deeply discounted.</p>
