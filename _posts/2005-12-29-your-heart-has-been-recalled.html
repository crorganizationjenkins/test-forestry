excerpt: The Food and Drug Administration has warned Guidant that, in the agency's
  opinion, it has not resolved the manufacturing problems detected in an earlier inspection.

<p><a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2005/fda_guidant.html">Not quite, actually</a>. But the pacemakers and defibrillators of medical device company Guidant aren't exactly inspiring the confidence of the influential "bad ticker" set.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Food and Drug Administration has warned Guidant that, in the agency's opinion, it has not resolved the manufacturing problems detected in an earlier inspection.

<p>Guidant was plagued throughout 2005 by problems with its cardiac defibrillator.</p>
<p>In June Guidant recalled 88,000 defibrillators and 28,000 pacemakers because of potential problems. The company blamed the recalls on "small, residual imperfections." The FDA ordered the recalls because of a faulty switch. The electronic devices are supposed to deliver a shock to the heart when they detect an arrythmia.<br />
I can't even imagine the logistical nightmare of recalling installed pacemakers. </p>
