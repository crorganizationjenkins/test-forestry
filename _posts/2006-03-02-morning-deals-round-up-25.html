<p>&bull; Amazon has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AQS0F/102-0392434-9450502"><i>Firefly</i> - The Complete Series</a> DVDs on sale for $20. If you like good TV, you'll like <i>Firefly</i>. Seriously, we've watched the series straight through like three times. [via <a href="http://slickdeals.net">SlickDeals</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; We're pretty sure you're all big nerds with broadband (or at least an unlimited dial-up account), but it might be useful to know that <a href="http://account.netzero.net/s/landing?group=freecorp&refcd=cj&cf=cj&AID=10388574&PID=227502">Netzero offers 10 hours per month</a> of dial-up access for free. (Although we're sure you have to sign up, which probably involves a credit card of something.) [via <a href="http://techbargains.com">TechBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon is running a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/526844/102-0392434-9450502">Kitchen and Home Clearance</a>, with prices up to 60% off&mdash;and much of the discounted items are remanufactured or refurbished, so they were pretty cheap to begin with. Add in an addition $25 off $125 or more coupon code <b>SPRINGIN</b> and you've got some decent savings potential. [via <a href="http://dealnews.com">DealNews</a>]</p>
