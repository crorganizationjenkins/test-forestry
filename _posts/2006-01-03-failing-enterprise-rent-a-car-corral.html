excerpt: Renting cars is a monumental pain in the rear. (We have our own saga that
  we will probably be discussing in the near future.) We don't have a particular preference
  for rental agencies, as they all seem bound by a byzantine set of regulations and
  limitations that are designed to extract every dollar while at the same time limiting
  your ability to actually rent a vehicle.

<p>Renting cars is a monumental pain in the rear. (We have our own saga that we will probably be discussing in the near future.) We don't have a particular preference for rental agencies, as they all seem bound by a byzantine set of regulations and limitations that are designed to extract every dollar while at the same time limiting your ability to actually rent a vehicle.</p>
<p>Some people apparently don't think much of Enterprise rent-a-car, however, and one has set up '<a href="http://failingenterprise.com">FailingEnterprise.com</a>,' where he not only details his personal problems with the company, but has set up forums for others to "share their misery" and a blog that details his ongoing attempts at a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<p>The claim to be the "2nd most popular company complaint site," so if you've got an inkling to take on a company yourself, you could do worse than to use Failing Enterprise as a template. (The first most popular? <a href="http://paypalsucks.com">PayPalSucks.com</a>.)</p>
