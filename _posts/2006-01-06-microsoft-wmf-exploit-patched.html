<p>Forecast for the 10th, <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/microsoft/yet-another-malicious-microsoft-image-exploit-146230.php">the WMF security exploit</a> was prioritized and patched overnight. If you're reading this over a morning cup of joe, you probably should already have it installed: there's no reason not to have "automatically download new updates" enabled on your computer. Never the less, going to <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com">windowsupdate.microsoft.com</a> and downloading patch KB912919 will get your machine prophylacticized as well. Unfortunately, it doesn't yet appear to be available through <a href="http://windowsupdate.62nds.com/">62NDS' Firefox Windows Update page</a>, though.</p>
