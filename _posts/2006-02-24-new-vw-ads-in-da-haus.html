<p>Volkswagon wants to 'un-pimp' your ride in a new campaign celebrating its German engineering heritage.</p>
<p>Ragtag urban youth get their tricked out hoopties destroyed in a secret laboratory and replaced by the clean, white, blond, superior engineered GTI's. </p>
<p>Are these the first Aryan Car Nation commercials?</p>
<p>Sexy vid after the 21 Jump Street...</p>

<p></p>
<p>"We just dropped it," on your car, "like it's hot. Representing Deutschland!"</p>

<p></p>
<p>"What does this do?"<br />
"It sucks in air."<br />
"It's definitely sucking."</p>

<p>"German engineering in da haus, ja."</p>
<p>The commercials were created by agency hotshop Cripsin Porter & Bogusky, who achieved fame and notoriety for their innovative Mini Cooper and creepy Burger King work.</p>
<p>Drawing upon a car company's national heritage is a tactic used successfully recently by Mistubishi.</p>
<p>Having grown into an industry giant, is CP&B now second-guessing itself, looking over its shoulder? Allusions to the "Farfegnugen" campaign are not difficult to draw.</p>
<p>Frankly, we expected something more freshmahker.</p>

<p>Bonus Notion: Say the tagline to VW's other new campaign with a German accent. "Make friends with your fast." It's not far from, "Make friends with your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust">Faust</a>."</p>
