<p>The Ford Fusion was <a href="http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2006/03/09/000121.html">voted</a> "Most Washable Car of 2006" by the <a href="http://www.carcarecentral.com/flashFull.html">International Carwash Association</a> (ICA).</p>
<p>Mark Thornsby, ICA's executive director, cites the Fusion's "moldings, bumpers, mirrors and wipers that are securely attached, its smooth lines, and its lack of dirt-trapping indentations and crevices." </p>
<p>"We salute Ford for its design of a truly exemplary vehicle," he said.</p>
