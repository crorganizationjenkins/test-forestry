<p>Gawkerite Scott Kidder has stumbled on a potentially handy bit of Dell Hellishness for those who have had the brass balls to order refurbished computers from the Dell Outlet&mdash;only to find they don't work.</p>
<p>It seems that the Service Tag remains the same after they send you the new machine, making it relatively easy for you to look up the problems which caused the <i>first</i> customer to send it in. Does that make your problems go away? Almost certainly not. (It didn't <a href="http://www.scottkidder.com/2006/01/the_dell_outlet_1.php">help Scott much</a>), but it might give you a little more ammo when pleading with Dell's customer service larvae to let you send your machine back for its second time.</p>
