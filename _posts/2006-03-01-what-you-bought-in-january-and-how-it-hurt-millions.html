<p>Yo, lured out to the stores by the warmest January in more than a century, you blithely spent at a rapid clip that outpaced your income.</p>
<p>What's up with that?</p>
<p>Your personal spending shot up .9% in January, the strongest gain in six months, while your income rose a solid .7%. </p>
<p>Respect.</p>
<p>But check this, like a sucka-ass trick, spending more than your after-tax income forced you to dip into prior savings or increase your borrowing.</p>
<p>Economists say that this is exactly the wrong time for your savings rate to dip into negative territory with the impending retirement of 78 million baby boomers, biatch.</p>
<p>Life ain't all applejacks n' jump-rope. Maybe you'll think a little first before your next spree?</p>
