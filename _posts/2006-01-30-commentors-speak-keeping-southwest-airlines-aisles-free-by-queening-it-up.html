<p>Dressing as flamboyantly as possible (fur hats . . . large sunglasses . . . tee shirts which graphically announce my homosexual proclivities)<br />
Lowering the tray table and using it as a desk while applying simple cosmetics such as mascara or eye-liner. This is something I only do when the flight looks like it's going to be *really* crowded. ;)</p>
<p>I suppose if none of that is up your alley you could wear a turban?Finally, a scenario where the prejudices of others pays in your favor. There have to be other places this sort of thing works. If you write about them in the comments, who knows? Maybe we'll get lazy in the future and cut-and-paste yours, too.</p>
