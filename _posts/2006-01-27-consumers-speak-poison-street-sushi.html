<p>As if putting up your complaints were not cut-and-pastey enough, reader Oz even sent us this totally functional title as well to his story of good lamb, mediocre sushi, and bad service.<br />

<p>Bond Street has an Omakase, which loosely translates to Chef's special. Typically a skilled sushi chef will build a selection of haute cuisine style sushi. We were asked if we had any special dietary concerns to which I replied gluten intolerant. I'm not sure if that phrase registers as disregard client, but i recIeved the first course with bread, while my gf and his fiancee munched away on tempura.</p>
<blockquote><p>The next two courses were served on blocks of ice, but the fish was warm - which prompted me to ask the waitress. They kindly sent an angry Korean girl over who insisted that the Omakase was fine. I've eaten Japanese food on three continents, but I suppose culinary experience is no substitute for adamant attitude.</p>
<p>My gf and my cousin's fianc<br />
e proceeded to their entree which was Sea Bass - not too, bad except for the taste was a bit off. The sauce was decent at least.</p>
<p>My cousin and I then received a lamb course - kind of odd for an Omakase - but what the hell, it's Bond Street Sushi. This turned out to be the tastiest thing all evening. Now while we were enjoying this culinary surprise amongst the mediocrity that was dinner, the guido next to us smacked his martini out of a waiter's hands - with the drink landing smack on my cousin (and the Guido  of course).</p>
<p>My cousin turned red; I couldn't stop laughing and the Guido ran out to his car to change his shirt. While this transpired - the efficient wait staff managed to grab my cousin's dish and leave him to dry himself off with his own napkin.</p>
<p>We summoned the manager to get his food back, however the angry Korean girl showed up again and started bantering about how he must have been done, otherwise they would never have taken his food. She also seemed irritated about the martini accident - not that it happened, rather that he was complaining.</p>
<p>Dessert turned out to be really delicious, but it didn't makeup for the crap service and so-so food. Especially when the food and drink bill totaled out at over $350.</p>
<p>So we paid, I noted to one of the managers how dissatisfied I was at the service and quality of food. I'm not sure if people really believe that they can talk you into having a good experience, after you just had a bad one - but she tried.</p>
<p>When I got home, I ended up a bit sick and on the toilet for a bit. Usually I let things roll off, but that was it.</p>
<p>Over the next few days I left 3 - 4 messages for their general manager with no return call. After a week of waiting, I called called my credit card co and contested the bill and then followed up with a call to the Health department to file a food poisoning complaint. Let me tell you that works magic on getting a return call. </p>
<p>A manager named Christine (not the GM) called me back to offer a gift certificate, to which I said I would not feel comfortable dining in her establishment again. She said, and I quote "We have never had a case of food poisoning here and are known for delicious food and excellent service"</p>
<p>She agreed to refund my money and we closed at that. </p>
<p>The funniest thing was when I mentioned this to one of my UES neighbors, whe noted "Oh, that place has really lousy food and pretentiuos service, plus they're not really a place to be seen anymore"</p>
<p>Perhaps if they were more popular the food would be better, who knew?!</p>
