excerpt: Although we can't recall ever seeing such a thing, apparently some Best Buy
  stores have giant numbers up near the register detailing information about that
  day's sales. A long blogger was intrigued enough to decode the numbers, and has
  explained their meaning on his site.

<p>Although we can't recall ever seeing such a thing, apparently some Best Buy stores have giant numbers up near the register detailing information about that day's sales. A long blogger was intrigued enough to decode the numbers, and has explained their meaning on <a href="http://www.cabel.name/2006/02/retail-secrets-best-buy-wall-numbers.html">his site</a>.</p>
<p>Learn these well enough and you'll be able to start all sorts of awkward coversations with your Best Buy employees. "I don't see the need to buy a Product Replacement Plan today when you're already over the corporate average today!"</p>
