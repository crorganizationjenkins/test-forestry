<p>We were going to pieces but our whore money/payola/free Sprint phone finally arrived. </p>
<p>These are the box contents. Wow, look at all that. </p>
<p>The phone itself is light. The screen is hi-rez and bright. There's a cover over the battery charging area. It hangs on by a little rubber strap that's pretty ingenious. An iPod-like play wheel sits on the face.</p>
<p>We'll tell you what exciting things happen next.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We are charging it.</p>
