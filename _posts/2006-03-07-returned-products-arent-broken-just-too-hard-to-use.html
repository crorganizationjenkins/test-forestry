<p>Complexity causes 50% of product returns, a new report finds.</p>
<p>A scientist reported Monday that half of all products returned are fully operational but people can't figure out how to work them.</p>
<p>She gave new products to a group of managers from Philips and asked them to use them over the weekend. The managers came back frustrated because they were unable to get the devices to work properly.</p>
<p>Multi-featured consumer electronics aren't phat, they're just big-boned.</p>
