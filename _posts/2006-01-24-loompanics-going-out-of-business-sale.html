excerpt: Alternative bookseller and publisher Loompanics—and by 'alternative,' we
  mean titles like 'ADVANCED TECHNIQUES OF CLANDESTINE PSYCHEDELIC AND AMPHETAMINE
  MANUFACTURE,' 'SATAN SPEAKS!' and 'HOW TO DATE YOUNG WOMEN'—is going out of business.
  They've put all their titles on sale for a flat 50% on a first-come, first-serve
  basis. With topic areas from 'Anarchism and Egosim' and 'Head for the Hills' to
  'Prison' and 'Rock and Roll,' Loompanics provides a wide variety of information
  for those who seek to step outside the norms of society—or at least impress high
  school crushes on Girls Who Do.

<p>Most businesses don't announce their going out of business after thirty years with a comic strip, either. That's classy. (Seriously.)</p>
