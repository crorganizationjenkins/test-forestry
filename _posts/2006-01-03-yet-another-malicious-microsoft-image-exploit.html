<p><em>'Computer security experts were grappling with the threat of a new weakness in Microsoft<br />
s Windows operating system that could put hundreds of millions of PCs at risk of infection by spyware or viruses.</em></p>
<p>The news marks the latest security setback for Microsoft, the world<br />
s biggest software company, whose Windows operating system is a favourite target for hackers.</p>
<p>
The potential [security threat] is huge,<br />
 said Mikko Hypp<br />
nen, chief research officer at F-Secure, an antivirus company.<br />
It<br />
s probably bigger than for any other vulnerability we<br />
ve seen. Any version of Windows is vulnerable right now.<br />
'</p>
<p>The vulnerabilty appears to be yet another exploit involving running malicious codes through images. Didn't you guys <em>just</em> supposedly fix this?</p>
<p><em>(Update: <a href="http://nweaver.blogspot.com/">Nicholas Weaver</a> posted a link in our Comments section directing us to instruction to <a href="http://handlers.dshield.org/jullrich/wmffaq.html">an unofficial patch</a>, along with the portent: "It really is that serious." Microsoft's patch? Due on January 10th.)</em></p>
