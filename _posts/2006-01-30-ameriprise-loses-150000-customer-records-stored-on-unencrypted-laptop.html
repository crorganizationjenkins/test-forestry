<blockquote><p> Ameriprise Financial, a recent spin-off of American Express, has notified more than 150,000 customers and more than 65,000 financial advisors of a potential data breach.</p>
<p>The company says a laptop computer containing sensitive personal information was stolen from a car in December.</p>
<p>The location of the city in which the theft took place was not divulged and the company isn't saying who the employee was. Company officials said the case is still under investigation.</p>
