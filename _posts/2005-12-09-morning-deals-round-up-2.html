<p>&bull; <a href="http://woot.com">Woot</a>'s pushing their own wine again. As homebrewers, we have nothing but empathy for their project. As drunks, we find the price of $55 for three bottles buzz prohibitive.</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon is discounting the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000204SWE/ref=nosim/103-3480039-1119032?n=172282">Philips DVP642 Divx-Certified Progressive Scan DVD Player</a> down to $50, with free shipping. That's a decent price, although not an amazing one. If you do not yet own a DVD player but find yourself open to the possibility, the DVP642 can also play most movies you've downloaded and burned to CD or DVD.

<p>&bull; Circuit City has a <a href="http://www.circuitcity.com/ccd/productDetail.do?oid=138319&carriage=befree&sourceid=qIbAQ5l9Eah0AlrDJSYC&com.broadvision.session.new=Yes&affiliateid=39502629&BV_UseBVCookie=No">Gamecube bundle</a> with two controllers and <i>Mario Party 7</i> for $99.99, shipped free. There are also two $15 off $100 coupons. Add something <a href="http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/NexxTech-Keychain-Flashlight-61-453-/sem/rpsm/oid/100398/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do?sourceid=qIZcQ5l9eg0gAlrDJUPB&affiliateid=39502629&carriage=befree">cheap</a> to meet the minimum, then use one: <b>NVAY8J6AJF</b> or <b>B9A4WD4A2J</b></p>
<p>&bull; Borders has a <a href="http://www.bordersstores.com/features/feature.jsp?file=corpappreciation">20% off employee coupon</a> that will expire in a couple of days.</p>
<p>&bull; Investiage the <a href="http://www.compusa.com/specials/fandf/ff1.asp?cm_ven=chth_em&cm_cat=em_1#">CompUSA Cost + 5% Sale</a>. We suspect some things will be a good value, but for many popular, high volume items, their margin is probably 5% or less already.</p>
<p>&bull; A complete Nintendo Entertainment System library is up for auction on <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=8241574452&indexURL=6#ebayphotohosting">eBay</a>. 781 titles, although not all are factory-sealed. Expect this to go in the high thousands.</p>
<p>&bull; Gawker upperclassman Jonno reminds us that the sick Calphalon sale at Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/url%3Dindex%3Dblended%26search-option%3Dsearch-amazon%26field-keywords%3Dcalphalon%2Bcommercial%26Go.x%3D0%26Go.y%3D0%26Go%3DGo/103-3480039-1119032">continues</a>.</p>
