<p>Rob Cockerham at Cockeyed.com tells us how we should all get paper shredders.</p>
<p>"I wasn't sure if just tearing a credit card application into tiny bits was good enough to prevent dumpster-diving theft, so I did a test.</p>
<p>I tore one up, then taped it back together again, filled it out with a DIFFERENT address and CELL number.</p>
<p>Sure enough, in four weeks I was rewarded with a shiny new card with a $5,000 limit.</p>
<p>Now I guess I'll go buy a shredder with this card." Read the rest <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/citizen/creditcard/application.shtml">here</a>. <em>(Thanks to <a href="http://www.danilocampos.com/">Danilo</a> and Andrew!)<br />
</em><br />
We're setting ours to liquefy. </p>
<p>Another reason to <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/howto/howto-stop-the-direct-marketers-157404.php">get yourself off the pre-approved credit card list</a>.</p>
