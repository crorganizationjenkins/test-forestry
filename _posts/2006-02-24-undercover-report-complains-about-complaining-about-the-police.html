<p>A citizen's watchdog group conducted an undercover investigation against south Florida police departments. 31 out of 34 departments surveyed had no forms available for citizens to register complaints against officers. </p>
<p>Furthermore, as <a href="http://cbs4.com/topstories/local_story_033170755.html">this video</a> shows, simply asking for a form resulted officers executing intimidation tactics against the complainants.</p>
<p>The video is by turns sad, surreal and scary, just like every day in south Florida. Bust some <em>Miami Vice</em> on that shznit!</p>
