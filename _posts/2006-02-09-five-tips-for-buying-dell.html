<p>DealHack's Dell Buyer's Guide might not be spanking new, but they've got a lot of practical advice on picking out a new PC or laptop. While it's probably worth visiting the article itself&mdash;it's a lot more in depth&mdash;here's the gist:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy one step below top-of-the-line. <i>Just like wine in a restaurant...</i>
</li>
<li>Decide your needs before you configure. <i>If you don't game, you'll probably save yourself some dough.</i>
</li>
<li>Make the most of coupon codes. <i>Wait for the good ones.</i>
</li>
<li>Buy and install additional memory yourself. <i>Crucial.com is your friend.</i>
</li>
<li>Buy online, not over the phone. <i>Because talking to people reminds you of the intelligence of Dell's workforce.</i></li>
</ol>
