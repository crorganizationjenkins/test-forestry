<p>As we prepare to enter the most wonderful time of the year&mdash;the time after the holidays are over&mdash;The Consumerist is working to help prepare you for the inevitable calls to customer service departments.

<p>Paul English's IVR Cheat Sheet is a frequently updated index of steps needed to "find a human." Some of the old tips still work, like pressing zero until you've discovered the multi-digit number that indicates the company's level of concern over your satisfaction. Others, like ###, poetically wink at the coursing blood that constricts your very brain.</p>

<p>* Customer service reps actually love this. It means they have to stay on the line, but don't have to talk to you. Give the gift of wasting an employer's money.</p>
