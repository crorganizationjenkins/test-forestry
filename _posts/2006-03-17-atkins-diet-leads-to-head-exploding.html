<p>No, it doesn't. But now that the lo-carb craze is over (again), our cholesterol-drenched hearts heaved a few millimeters higher to hear the results of the latest report decrying the Atkins Diet fad.</p>
<p>After "strictly following the Atkins diet for a month" doctors following a "40-year-old white female patient" found she was "was vomiting as often as six times daily and had difficulty breathing...she reported a weight loss of 9 kilograms (20 pounds) while on the diet."</p>
<p>8kg of that weight loss was attributed to the release of her builtup body stores of vomit. More, after the jump...</p>
<p>The report found, "a study of two 12-month trials showed that those on the low-carbohydrate diet had lost ``significantly more'' weight at the 6-month stage than those on a low-fat diet."</p>
<p>Really? Forget Jared, we're throwing all our loaves of bread out the window. But wait, there's more...</p>
<p>"Over the full 12 months, however, no significant difference in weight loss was observed between the traditional low-fat diet and a low-carb one," the study said. </p>
<p>"Low-carbohydrate diets for weight management 'are far from healthy' given their association with constipation or diarrhea, halitosis, headache and general fatigue, among other side effects, Dr. Lyn Steffen of the University of Minnesota School of Public Health wrote."</p>
<p>Eat fewer calories than you use. Exercise. Lose weight. Check please.</p>
