excerpt: AOL's dial-up customer service department has a reputation for being slow
  to answer and quick to anger. The Consumerist put one AOL customer service rep,
  selected at random, to the Stress Test. His name was Aaron.

<p>AOL's dial-up customer service department has a reputation for being slow to answer and quick to anger. The Consumerist put one AOL customer service rep, selected at random, to the Stress Test. His name was Aaron.</p>
<p>How well does an AOL phone jockey handle an irregular customer calling to cancel his account? Listen here to find out. [<a href="http://www.consumerist.com/audio/consumerist_aol.mp3">2MB MP3</a>]</p>
<p>Hard numbers and final score after the jump.</p>
<p><b>The Verdict</b></p>
<p>Aaron had a capable, if slightly tardy response to our complaint, going so far as to question if we had contacted parties outside of Time Warner. We applaud his willingness to delicately respond with a suitable amount of bewildered empathy. He did seem eager to rush us from the phone, however, for which we must deduct a point from his final score.</p>
<p><b>The Stats</b></p>
<p>Total call time: <i>11 minutes</i><br />
Hold time: <i>3 minutes</i><br />
Call placed: <i>Sunday evening</i><br />
Phone Number: <i>800-4ON-LINE</i></p>
<p><i>AOL's </i>Consumerist Stress Test<i> Score: Four diddled bulldogs out of five.</i></p>
