<p>"..."</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, we have a new advertiser. All hail the glory of the William Shatner DVD club. </p>
<p>But there seems to be something more, something ineffable, something left unexpressed by the animated GIF, something that's bursting out to be said.</p>
<p>We can't tell what. </p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>Submit your captions in the comments. Winner gets a free frickin' Gawker t-shirt.</p>
