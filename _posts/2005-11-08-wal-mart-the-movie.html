<p>Detailing the means through which the Arkansas giant continues its retail dominance, <i>WAL-MART: The High Cost of Low Price</i> is now in wide community screening and available for purchase online. We haven't seen it yet, so must reserve judgement, but are intrigued by the website's promise of <a href="http://www.walmartmovie.com/china.php">sweaty Chinese laborers named Princess</a>.</p>
<p>And because no movie premiere would be complete without the compulsory media blitz, Brave New Films has also launched an "<a href="http://www.walmartmovie.com/blog.php">impressive editorial collaboration</a>" with writers from The Nation and Alternet, among others. They've even launched not one, but two blogs: one <a href="http://www.walmartmovie.com/blog.php">about the film</a>, and one written in the voice of their mascot, '<a href="http://www.iheartwalmart.com/">Evil Smiley</a>.' Nothing capitulate a mega-corp like the ironic cartoon voice.</p>
