<p>&bull; Amazon has the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065ANYC/ref=nosim/102-0392434-9450502?n=172282">SanDisk 2GB Ultra II Secure Digital Memory Card</a> for $88, shipped free. We're considering buying it, despite the fact that SD is our least-used memory card format.</p>
<p>&bull; Okay, so J&R has the <a href="http://www.jr.com/JRProductPage.process?Product_Id=4028962&JRSource=linkshare.datafeed.PNY+PFD02GU20RF">PNY 2GB Flash Drive</a> for just $80 plus shipping. (Although it appears they are out of stock.) Apparently flash memory just took another one of those price dives that happen from time to time. Or, even more likely, we just noticed it.</p>
<p>&bull; <strike>Pay just $10 shipping and handling to get a free<i>ish</i> USB-based dance pad from <a href="http://www.kraftbrands.com/activegame/pad.aspx?e=email">Kraft Cheese</a>.</strike> Expired!</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a> is a heart monitor that you can strap to your wrist for $25.</p>
