<p>If you want good service, you'll have to dress the part.</p>
<p>A new study finds that the better clothed and groomed a woman is, the friendlier and faster service she'll receive from salesclerks.</p>
<p>Therefore, the best way to avoid sales people from 'assisting' you every twenty seconds is to make your shopping spree coincide with Inside-Out Backwards Day. </p>
<p>Or, consider this: how can the clerk judge you based on your clothes if you enter in the nude?</p>
