<p>For those who haven't had a chance to play with it, European money is actually rather cool. Bills are colored fluorescently and each denomination has a different size, making it easy to distinguish a specific bill simply by blindly rooting in your pockets Each denomination also has radically different designs. But they are all very serious, and we mourn some of the bills that the euro replaced &mdash;  such as a 50 franc bill with children's book character The Little Prince on the face of it. Yes, it was very much like having Bugs Bunny on the front of a $1 dollar bill. But our currency could only be improved by that.</p>
<p>As for the Euro, bills are colorful, yes, but are missing some of the playful frivolity of the old currencies. So we can't help but wish that these counterfeit Euro bills being passed off successfully in Germany were real. On these bills, the grim, humorless visages of snooty European politicians are replaced by come-hither porn stars and cheesecake hunks, and the ring of stars usually on Euro currency has been replaced by a ring of hearts. (<em>Correction: Jeez, I'm an idiot. Despite the fact that I've been handling euros on a daily basis for about four years, I didn't realize they didn't have faces on them. Leonard corrects me after the jump!</em>)</p>
<p>The police aren't amused, but we are. Buying things <em>should</em> be more fun.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: From Leonard, who pays more attention to the money in his billfold than I do:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are no people on our beloved Euros. See http://www.euro.ecb.int/en/more/communication/download1.html or http://www.europa4young.de/enoten.htm </p>
<p> Why?</p>
<p>Can you imagine who would be on the 500 Euro bill. It would have to be a german-born Englishman who grew up in France to later become king of Spain only to marry the italian prime-minister.</p>
<p>We couldn't cope with that, so we put bridges and other buildings on there. Mind you the Buildings are not real, but just represent different styles found throughout europe. </p>
<p>Cheers<br />
