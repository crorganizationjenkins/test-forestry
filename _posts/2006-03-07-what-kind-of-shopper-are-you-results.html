<p>Results of poll started on February 22nd asking, <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/circlejerking/we-need-to-peer-inside-your-brain-156131.php">What Kind of Shopper Are You</a>?</p></p>
<p><strong>53.6%</strong> of you are compelled more by chemical imbalances than logic and thrift into finding the lowest price.<br />
<strong>19.5%</strong> are simply cheap bastards.<br />
<strong>12.1%</strong> would buy your groceries at online auction if you could.<br />
<strong>8.9%</strong> get it from "a guy you know."<br />
<strong>6%</strong> enjoy rummaging through garbage to find unused food and products.<br />
Disgusting, yet frugal!</p>
