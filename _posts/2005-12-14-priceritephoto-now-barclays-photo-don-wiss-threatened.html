excerpt: Thomas Hawk continues his investigation into PriceRitePhoto, telling us the
  scam photo seller has changed its name to 'Barclay's Photo.'Thus far the names that
  seem to be tying together include PriceRitePhoto, Barclay's Photo, Film4Less, Edigix,
  CP Industries, The Camera Zone, TheCameraMall, Film Shop, Film Shop Clipper USA.Even
  worse, it would appear that Don Wiss, the guy who biked around Brooklyn taking pictures
  of the spaces the camera shops weren't, has received a death threatâ€”just like the
  call Lee Holmes got just a couple of months ago.

<p>Is it possible that all these bad Brooklyn camera stores are actually being run by just a few people?</p>
