excerpt: TIME.com reports on the efforts of Forest Ethics, an environmental advocacy
  group, to curtail the 1 million catalogs a day that Victoria's Secrets mass mails
  out. Since 25% of the paper that Victoria's Secrets uses comes from the Great Boreal
  Forest, that's a lot of endangered trees chainsawed down to feed the pitiful boners
  of millions of lonely 13 year olds looking for a cheap source of pubescent titillation.

<p>It should be noted Forest Ethics is one of the less obnoxious and hippy dippy environmental advocacy groups that we've come across, believing more in consistent, persuasive , unyielding dialog with companies to realize their goals, as opposed to the usual prescription of tiresome martyresque hysteria. Forest Ethics' executive director Todd Paglia also seems to have a meaty coconut perched atop his neck.</p>
<blockquote><p>"In the Internet age, printing catalogs at this volume is like running cars on a steam engine," [Paglia] says. "It would be quaint if it weren't so destructive."</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the Internet can't be stored in a rather coppery smelling wicker basket next to your toilet. Well, not yet, anyway. </p>
