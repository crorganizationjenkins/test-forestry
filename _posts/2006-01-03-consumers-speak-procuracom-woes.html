<p>Reader Scott has had a mess of trouble with online retailer Procura.com. He's done a great job detailing the problems he's had, so have a look for yourself, including more after the jump.<br />
<blockquote>I was looking for a Sirius S50 Home Docking kit.<br />
 Every online retailer (and several local stores) I checked did not have any in stock.<br />
 Then I found Procura.com, a Yahoo! Shopping merchant.<br />
 Their site said they have 2 in stock, ready to ship.<br />
 I ordered one.
 </p></blockquote>
<p>The next day, they sent me an email saying it was on back order, and they'd ship it when it's back in stock.<br />
 In that email, they gave me an email address to write to if I wanted to cancel.<br />
 I wrote to that address, cancelling my order.<br />
 My email immediately bounced back; the address was no good.<br />
 I went to their site ( procura.com), and after digging around, I found a different "cancellation" email address, so I wrote to that one, but not before re-checking to see if they updated the stock status.<br />
 They did not; it still said 2 in-stock.<br />
 So I sent my new cancellation email to the new email address.<br />
 It, too, bounced back, as this was yet another bad email address. </p>
<blockquote><p>I replied to the original confirmation email, telling them that I want to cancel, telling them that they give 2 bad email addresses, and telling them that they still list the item as in stock.<br />
 Surprisingly, that one didn't bounce.<br />
 The next day, they responded, saying they'd cancel my order, and oddly enough, the response was from a Gmail account...</p>
<p>The next day, I got an "order status update" email, telling me the item is still on back order, but they'd ship my order when the item is in.<br />
 Grrrrrrr.....<br />
 I wrote back, only this time, I used the Gmail address they sent from earlier.<br />
 No response.
 </p>
<p>I went back to their site & checked the status; yep, you guessed it: 2 S50 Home Kits in-stock & ready to ship, they claim.
 </p>
<p>The next day (today), I got an email from Procura.com , but no, it wasn't a re-confirmation of my re-cancellation, it was another "order status update," telling me it's still on back order, but will ship when it's in....
 </p>
<p>Now I know this is the exact reverse order one should follow, but I went to the Yahoo! Merchant Rating page to see what others had said about Procura.com; had I gone there first, I would have seen that this is a pattern with Procura.com, dating back over 16 months of reviews.<br />
 Many people experienced the same issues I've been dealing with from Procura.com.<br />
 Also, they suspiciously have absolutely no contact information listed on their Yahoo! Merchant Information page...</p>
<p>Having not again heard from Procura.com, I contacted Yahoo! Shopping to register my complaint.<br />
 I use a separate debit card solely for online purchases (one that I only replenish with just enough to cover the cost of a purchase, and only just prior to placing an order), so I made sure I don't have funds available, should Procura.com try to scam me out of my hard-earned money, but this sort of thing just pisses me off.
 </p>
<p>A closer look at Procura.com's site showed some other "suspicious" statements & practices: <br />
&bull; on their home page (and every other Procura.com page), they state they have a 5-star Yahoo! Merchant rating.<br />
 They do not.<br />
 <br />
&bull; In order to check the stock of an item, you click the "check stock" button, but that button also activates their "buy" button, placing the item in your cart.<br />
 <br />
&bull;You aren't allowed to find out how much your shipping charge will be until you enter your name, address, and credit card numbers. Why do they do that?<br />
 Because their shipping charges are truly outrageous!<br />
 I was willing to pay a higher shipping charge for the S50 Home kit because they were the only ones who had it in stock (or so I was lead to believe). <br />
&bull;As stated previously, they use multiple email addresses, listing inactive addresses as the "cancellation" contacts.<br />
&bull;And the best one of all is that they STILL show the S50 Home Kit as being in-stock & ready to ship.<br />
 Amazing... </p>
