<p>&bull; Here's a deal for we penny pinchers: SuperMediaStore.com has the <a href="http://www.supermediastore.com/kilwateldet1.html?WT.mc_id=dealnewsdealsubmission051227">Kill-A-Watt</a> Electricity Monitor for $29, shipped. This little gewgaw tells you how much power each device you plug into it uses, equipping you with the knowledge that your desktop document incinerator is actually sort of power hungry.</p>
<p>&bull; It's hardly a beast, but DealNews tells you how to get a hold of the <a href="http://dealnews.com/deals/Dell-Inspiron-1300-1-4-GHz-14-Widescreen-Notebook-for-499-shipped/110227.html">Dell Inspiron 1300 1.4GHz 14-inch Widescreen Laptop</a> for $500, shipped. That's the magic price point for many people, and this particular model can be had for even less without the DVD burner.</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon sells the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009Q4UBK/102-0392434-9450502?n=172282">iAudio X5 30GB Portable Multimedia Player</a> for $266, shipped. It's the iPod video for people who don't want to deal with the iPod's shortcomings (or its benefits).</p>
<p>&bull; Geeks.com has a <a href="http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=VPD-TRIPOD&sourceid=00384104774967759786">53-inch aluminum camera tripod</a> for $10, plus shipping. Includes a built-in level. [via <a href="http://bensbargains.net">BensBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a> is a 76-inch 16:9 InFocus projection screen for $45. That's a good price, even if 76 inches is a little on the small side for front projectors.</p>
