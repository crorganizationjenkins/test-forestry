excerpt: "â€¢ Buy a man's poverty on eBay for a buck. And if it just takes a buck to
  get him out of poverty, you might be able to complain that you didn't buy as much
  poverty as you were led to believe."

<p>&bull; Buy a man's <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=5657249301">poverty on eBay for a buck</a>. And if it just takes a buck to get him out of poverty, you might be able to complain that you didn't buy as much poverty as you were led to believe.</p>
<p>&bull; Macy's is running a <a href="http://www.macys.com/catalog/index.ognc?CategoryID=9436&PartnerID=LINKSHARE&LinkshareID=lw9MynSeamY-eMlUqbmyHkbrlEGg80kpEA&PageID=9436*1*12*-1*-1">clearance sale</a> with 40 to 70% discounts, <i>plus</i> $.99 shipping with code <b>99CENTS</b>. Pretty hot. Over 3,000 sale items, and not all of them are DKNY loungewear.</p>
<p>&bull; And if you can't find some button-down shirts at Macy's, Amazon is selling shirts from Arrow, Calvin Klein, and Kenneth Cole at a discount&mdash;as low as $12. <a href="http://slickdeals.net/#p6967">Slickdeals</a> has a short list.</p>
<p>&bull; Office Depot is selling the <a href="http://www.officedepot.com/ddSKU.do?level=SK&id=943000">Palm TX PDA</a> for $260 after a $40 off $200 code: <b>28891600</b>. There's also a <a href="http://forms.young-america.com/31490_OD1802002%20v2%20-%20011006.pdf">$30 mail-in rebate</a>, should you want to screw around with it. (And you should, because $260 is about what the TX goes in most stores.)</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot</a>: A mystery! It's currently showing those Bluetooth headsets from yesterday, but we swear we just checked it a few minutes ago and it had an iPod speaker system on there.</p>
