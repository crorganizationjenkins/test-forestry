<p>Bust out the absinthe, we got in the New York Times this weekend.</p>
<p>"It's unlikely that readers of the Consumerist blog will pick what truly is the "Worst Company in America," but they will have fun trying."</p>
<p>That's from the New York Times, 2/25/06, "What's Online" by Dan Mitchell. Read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/25/technology/25online.html?_r=1&oref=slogin ">here</a>. Archival <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/22506nyt.jpg">here</a></p>
<p>The article, a roundup of<br />
What<br />
s Online<br />
 and business related, starts off with the officepirates.com crap and quotes Gawker.com. That<br />
s two Gawker Media properties in one article. It<br />
s true folks, Nick Denton gives payola to the New York Times to do our bidding. Respect.</p>
<p>What's truly awesome is that this is all made by you. You, in all your beautiful youtitude, picked the companies and placed the votes. </p>
<p>Appearing in the NYT means some people are paying attention to what<br />
s going on here. Some of them run companies. Some of them are even literate. </p>
<p>Awesome work. Next up, let<br />
s do the Wall Street Journal.</p>
