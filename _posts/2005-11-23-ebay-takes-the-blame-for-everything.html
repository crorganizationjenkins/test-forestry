excerpt: This guerrilla campaign by eBay in Brussels shows how marketing obviates
  the need for facts and figures when a hastily-slapped sign can say so much more.
  These stores went out of business, for god-knows-what reasons—perhaps a death in
  the family, or a shortage of mayonnaise—but that didn't stop eBay from taking the
  credit.
