excerpt: The very fine "I Will Teach You to Be Rich" blog has a good entry today on
  "The Failure of the Last Mile." The post relates to how companies will spend millions
  on high-falutin back-end systems, only to have their front desk manned by a surly
  micro-despot with the compassion and intellect of a pebble.
