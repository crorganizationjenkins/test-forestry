excerpt: "â€¢ In places in the midwest, there is an almost religious respect given to
  the mighty Chipotle. We suspect it is not that their burritos are so excellent,
  although they are certainly good, but that in our fast food nation, food that actually
  uses fresh vegetables should be cherished. Chipotle is running a promotion that
  will probably make the college boys go even wilder: Buy a $5 gift card between now
  and the 11th, bring the receipt back between the 12th and 14th, and receive a free
  burrito. Value! [via SlickDeals]"

<p>&bull; <strike>Not exactly a full game, but a special version of the surprisingly enjoyable Trackmania racing game is available for <a href="http://www.trackmanianations.com/">free download</a> to your PC. Don't think racing sim so much as arcade racer (although we haven't played this new version).</strike> <i>Update: Don't download this. It installs potentially harmful software on your PC. Our apologies.</i></p>
<p>&bull; CompUSA has the <a href="http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=336361&cm_ven=dealm_site&cm_cat=deals1_2006&cm_pla=site&cm_ite=dealmac">Nikon D50 digital SLR camera</a> for $600 with included 18-55mm lens. We're a Canon family around here, but have heard nothing but good things about the D50.</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a> A Creative Labs USB Bluetooth adapter for twenty bucks. Okay deal, but you should start getting Bluetooth built-in to your machines if you can.</p>
