excerpt: We don't have an iPod. We have a first-generation Dell DJ. Compared to the
  design of the opalescent obelisk ubiquitously clutched in every hipster's hand,
  the Dell DJ is striking. It looks exactly as if Soviet super-scientists invented
  a time machine, traveled to the future, copped on to the inherently socialist nature
  of the music trading scene, and — traveling back to their own era — attempted to
  make their own mp3 player out of a two-inch plate of Soviet-grade titanium tank
  plating. Fifty years later, Dell.ru found about a million of these in an abandoned
  Muscovite silo, dusted them off, formatted "Lenin's Greatest Hits" off the hard
  drive and sold them as is, to idiots like probably-not-you but definitely-royal-'we'.

We don't have an iPod. We have a first-generation Dell DJ. Compared to the design of the opalescent obelisk ubiquitously clutched in every hipster's hand, the Dell DJ is striking. It looks exactly as if Soviet super-scientists invented a time machine, traveled to the future, copped on to the inherently socialist nature of the music trading scene, and &mdash; traveling back to their own era &mdash; attempted to make their own mp3 player out of a two-inch plate of Soviet-grade titanium tank plating. Fifty years later, Dell.ru found about a million of these in an abandoned Muscovite silo, dusted them off, formatted "Lenin's Greatest Hits" off the hard drive and sold them as is, to idiots like probably-not-you but definitely-royal-'we'.</p>
<p>This has made syncing our Dell DJ with our iTunes collection a bit of a bitch. So we were pleased to find <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/itunes/download-of-the-day-itunes-agent-158457.php">Lifehacker's luscious apparati</a> reporting on iTunesAgent, a system-tray syncer between iTunes and whatever crappy iPod "killer" you got suckered into buying.</p>
<p>We post this because we just <em>know</em> that some of our savvy Consumerist readers have had philosophical objections to Apple's DRM policies, decided to take a stand, bought a Zen Nomad and have been sliding down the slippery slope right into iTunes' Sarlaac-like maw ever since.</p>
