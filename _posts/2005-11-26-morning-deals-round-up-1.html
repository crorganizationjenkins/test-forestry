<p>&bull; Grab Turbo Tax Basic, Quicken Deluxe '06, and a paper shredder at Staple's online store for $0 after 'easy rebates.' (Easy rebates can be processed online.) Get the codes at <a href="http://slickdeals.net/#p6750">SlickDeals</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; One more day of Circuit City's deal on the <a href="http://www.circuitcity.com/ccd/productDetail.do?c=1&b=g&u=c&qp=0&oid=100066&AID=10380860&PID=227502&URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.circuitcity.com%2Fdetail.jsp%3Fc%3D1%26b%3Dg%26u%3Dc%26qp%3D0%26oid%3D100066">Philips DVP642 DVD/Divx Player</a> for $45 with free shipping. It's a mostly-competent progressive scan DVD player, but it can also play almost every time of video file available on burned DVDs and CDs&mdash;perfect if you get your media from the halls of the mountain nerd.
