<p>Check out gethuman.com's database of secret numbers and codes to quickly get a human on many company's customer service lines. It's an evolution of the original-flavored Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Cheat Sheet we <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/customer-service/ivr-cheat-sheet-get-a-human-on-the-line-139190.php">posted</a> about, but with lots more companies and info.</p>
<p>Most of these cheats either require mashing 0 repeatedly or silently lurking until the system connects you.</p>
<p>To reach a human at...</p>
<p>To reach a human at GHI, an HMO, call 212-501-4444. "Don't answer, it takes about three cycles of loop."</p>
<p>For Bellsouth (Repair), call 877-737-2478. "As soon as the IVR starts press 0 once every second until you are told you'll be transfered to a representitive."</p>
<p>For McDonald<br />
s, call 1-800-244-6227 and play the sounds of five, beef tallow dipped, sacrificed virgins being sold to Hindus.</p>
<p>Gethuman.com is completely run by volunteers and relies on submissions to grow its database. Of the site's intent, Mr. English said, "I want companies to wake up and ask themselves, 'How did we ever let it get this bad?' "</p>
<p>For, if the IVR is such an efficiency, then how about all the times you dial in all your requested info to the phonebot, only to have the human ask you for the same information?</p>
<p>The best way to cut call center costs is not by outsourcing to Pakistan. The best way to cut call center costs is to be a good company, do your job right and be nice, <em>especially</em> if there's a flub.</p>
