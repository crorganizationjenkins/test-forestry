<p>Passengers were removed from an Alaskan Airlines flight after a bullet was found in the cabin.</p>
<p>No guns or other disconcerting objects were found during a subsequent search. Nobody knows how the slug got onboard.</p>
<p>Alaskan Airline spokeswoman Caroline Boren noted that the airline flies many hunters to Alaska, and that from time to time, bullets have fallen out of passengers' pockets, reported the Chicago Tribune.</p>
<p>You'd think that'd be something the metal detector would pick up. Maybe they were too busy looking for lit fuses coming out of the passengers hiking boots.</p>
