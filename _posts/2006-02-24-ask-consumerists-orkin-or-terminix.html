<p>Wesley asks via the tipline, Orkin or Terminix, who's better?</p>
<p>He's researching getting his home treated as a preventitive measure against the wood gobblers and has found several complaints against both companies. </p>
<p>Any thoughts, good or bad, especially in reference to their termite plans?</p>
<p>Having a house with no wood touching the ground is a good way to go. Even still, termites can traverse these with mud tunnels!</p>
<p>Here's a short <a href="http://www.epestsupply.com/termite_identification.htm">primer</a> on identifying if you have termite infestation.</p>
<p>Although it's a pretty good sign "Yes" if your house looks like <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/term.php" onclick="window.open('http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/term.php','popup','width=507,height=336,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">this</a>.</p>
