<p>Just a quick reminder that yesterday's Woot Off&mdash;where Woot drops one deal after another until each item is sold&mdash;continues apace.</p>
<p>We were less than impressed with yesterday's offerings, but the Woot Off remains a fun way to keep a browser window refreshed all day. If you use Firefox, you can use the <a href="http://reloadevery.mozdev.org/">Reload Every</a> plugin to make the refreshing automatic.</p>
