<p>A strange glitch on the online Target gift registry service is causing one bride-to-be's registry to display something odd. Right next to "Pyrex 16-pc. Starter Set" and "KitchenAid 2-qt. Red Teakettle" there's a skillet listed as "Monkey Full Bedskirt."  </p>
<p>Robyn Allen asked Target via the contact form to fix her list but as of this morning it was still <a href="http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/602-2508252-3761410?%5Fencoding=UTF8&coliid=I1D9M3H17GAV1W&asin=B0009P8VL6&colid=24D8AJDPRNX34&bckreg=cw">there</a>.  [Archival <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/bigmonkey.jpg">here</a>]</p>
<p>"I'm sure the bridal shower guests will be suitably confused when they go to print out my registry," says Robyn, "but maybe that will make things more interesting."</p>
<p>Odd. But at least now we know where to get the full monkey bedskirt to compliment our demi and mini monkey bedskirts.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There's definitely something funky going on with <a href="http://www.target.com/gp/browse.html/ref=in_se_pagelist/602-2508252-3761410?%5Fencoding=UTF8&node=13428131&index=tgt-mf-mv&field-browse=13428131&rank=pmrank&size=16&page=6">Target's cast iron cookware</a>, as seen in this very heavy looking, "<a href="http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/ref=br_1_9/602-2508252-3761410?%5Fencoding=UTF8&frombrowse=1&asin=B0009Q401U">Chenille Throw"</a> [archival <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/chenille.jpg">here</a>] and this culinary inspired "<a href="http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/ref=br_1_5/602-2508252-3761410?%5Fencoding=UTF8&frombrowse=1&asin=B0009P8VKC">Swimmingly Purple Art Box</a>."
