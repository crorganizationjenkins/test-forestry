excerpt: New York City's newest Apple store, currently under construction on Fifth
  Avenue and set to open in May, is not only going to be one of the larger Apple retail
  stores in the world; it's also apparently going to be open twenty-four hours a day,
  seven days a week. This all night Mac house will be slinging iPods and Macbooks
  to jittery, bleary-eyed addicts in the heart of Manhattan, even as innocent citizens
  sleep nearbyâ€”at least until the East Side neighborhood associations start to complain.

<p>New York City's newest Apple store, currently under construction on Fifth Avenue and set to open in May, is not only going to be one of the larger Apple retail stores in the world; it's also apparently going to be open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.

<p>We're ashamed to say so, but we'll probably go there at least once in the wee hours just because we can. Because in the city that never sleeps, the only thing less cool than going to the Apple store will be going to the Apple store when there's <i>actually something fun to do elsewhere</i>.</p>
