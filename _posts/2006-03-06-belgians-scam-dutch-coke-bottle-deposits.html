<p>Everyone remembers the Seinfeld episode where Kramer and Newman attempted to double their profit on soda bottle deposits by taking New York cans and exchanging them in Michigan. Now Belgium's New York to the Netherlands' Michigan is getting in on the act, attempting to take advantage of the Netherlands' truly absurd bottle deposit fee ($0.30).</p>
<blockquote><p>The scheme takes advantage of a recent move by Coke's Dutch arm to introduce new bottles that are identical to the ones used in Belgium - but the Dutch bottles carry a euro0.25 (US$0.30) deposit.</p>
<p>While the Netherlands' NOS television reported that Belgians were bringing bottles across the border in "massive" numbers, a Coke spokeswoman downplayed the story.</p>
