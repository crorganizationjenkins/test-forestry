excerpt: It's the season of shipping, when every stocking is stuffed with truck stop
  amphetamines and UPS men cry themselves to sleep at the wheel. So far we've lucked

<p>It's the season of shipping, when every stocking is stuffed with truck stop amphetamines and UPS men cry themselves to sleep at the wheel. So far we've lucked out&mdash;nearly all our packages have come in with ample packing and nary a scuffed corner.</p>
<p>But our luck is surely just that. Let The Consumerist see your most poorly packaged items. Include pictures if you can, so that we may share your pain with the 10th-most-popular marketing engine, the internet.</p>
