  because it's painfully ironic.

<p>So as much as it pains me&mdash;Joel&mdash;to say this, I've got to tell you what I did, because it's painfully ironic.</p>
<p>Remember our <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/contest/starbucks-contest-the-winner-150308.php">Starbucks Contest</a>? Remember Gregg Schultz, the winner of the contest, to who we were to send a $500 gift card?</p>
<p>Yeah... I totally forgot to do that. I sent it in with my girlfriend so she could ship it via UPS instead of US Mail (so we could insure it cheaply), and then neglected to ever give her Gregg's address.</p>
<p>So my apologies, Gregg. It went out today.</p>
<p>We were already making you go back to the very place you swore you hated, Gregg. Consider this the sour cherry on top of your bittersweet mocha.</p>
