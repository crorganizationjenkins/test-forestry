<p>Hot Deals sites are a dime a dozen, but the deals are almost always for junk you didn't actually plan on buying. How does one discover discounts on products one actually <i>wants</i> to buy? The coupon page at Smarter.com is one stop.</p>
<p>At Smarter, you can browse by store, to try and find a coupon for a product you've already got in your cart. Or browse by category, and tailor your purchase to the store offering the deepest discount.</p>
<p>Is the Smarter coupon site the most comprehensive coupon aggregator around? We have no clue&mdash;we just started using it ourselves. If you've got a better option, we'd love to hear about it.</p>
