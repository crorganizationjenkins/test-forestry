excerpt: Verizon does something evil? Surely not our sweet, beatific megacorp! Yet
  that is the claim levied by the wicked town of Lonaconing, Maryland, whose annual
  Christmas lights were banned—for safety's sake—by Verizon. Each year Lonaconing's
  Christmas Light Decoration Committee would string their vine-like lights across
  the same poles used by Allegheny Power and Verizon to provide light and warmth to
  hundreds of poor children in the coal town.''If a wire is hanging at 15 feet, a
  truck could snag it. It could snap a pole, and someone could get seriously injured,"
  Verizon spokeswoman Sandra Arnette said. ''We never said the town should not hang
  the lights. But safety is the first thing."The first thing is safety, Lonaconing,
  not your vile, pagan celebration! We would wish you coal in every stocking if we
  did not already imagine it would give your dwarvish children great joy to fondle
  each sooty treasure betwixt their stumpy mole fingers. And to put an inflatable
  Grinch balloon next to the Verizon office? Take your idolatry elsewhere, Lonaconing.
  We'll have none of your craven imagery in this, the season of plastic, light-up
  Jesus.
