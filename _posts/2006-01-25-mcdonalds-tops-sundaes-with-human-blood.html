<p>Man, it's a great day for disgusting fast food stories. First, the <a href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/fast-food/family-eats-roach-sandwiches-at-kfc-150677.php">Kentucky Fried Roachwich</a> and now, a customer who ordered a McDonald's strawberry sundae and discovered it was topped with a different crimson liquid entirely&mdash;<a href="http://apnews.excite.com/article/20060120/D8F8KRUG0.html">human blood</a>.<br />
<blockquote>According to court documents, Jara bought food, including four hot fudge sundaes, at the restaurant's drive-thru window on Dec. 30, 2004.</p></blockquote>
<p>Her son, now 13, dug into his sundae and "recognized the taste of blood and, upon careful inspection, noted a red substance on the side of the sundae cup as well as mixed into his ice cream," the lawsuit claims.</p>
<p>Jara then went into the store and spoke to a swing manager, who confirmed that it was blood, according to the lawsuit. The manager, Joshua Ferrell, said the employee who prepared the sundae had an injured, bleeding finger, and told Jara that he had advised the employee to keep a bandage on his finger, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Jara, who filed a report with Georgetown police, requested that the employee, who no longer works at the restaurant, undergo a blood test to rule out any diseases, but that her request was refused.Perhaps Bob Langert should write a post about this on his <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/pr/mcdonalds-starts-corporate-responsibility-blog-150403.php">McDonald's Corporate Responsibility Blog.</a> Maybe he should write that post <i>right this minute.</i></p>
