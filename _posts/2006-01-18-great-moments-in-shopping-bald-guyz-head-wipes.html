excerpt: 'Aaron writes, "I was just at Duane Reade in the Rock Center Concourse and
  I saw the best thing in the world: It''s called "Bald Guyz Head Wipes" and it notes
  on that packaging that it''s for wiping the shiny oils off the top of your bald
  head.  It doesn''t appear to be a joke even.'

<p>It's called "Bald Guyz Head Wipes" and it notes on that packaging that it's for wiping the shiny oils off the top of your bald head.  It doesn't appear to be a joke even.  There were several other products in the Bald Guyz line of products for...uh...bald guys, but every one in the store was staring at me and my lustrous-headed self as I took camera-phone pics of this box that I didn't have time to peruse the others.  Just wanted to let bald Consumerist readers know that they need to longer be embarrassed by their shiny bald heads and forced to resort to wiping it down with discarded NY Posts.  There is now a special product for you!</i>"</p>
