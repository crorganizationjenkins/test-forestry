excerpt: Consumer Reports released its annual top 10 auto report.

<p>Consumer Reports released its annual top 10 auto report.</p>
<p>It's the first time not a single American car company graced the list. The list, reprinted below, is swept away by Japanese autos.</p></p>
<p>Mainly because American cars suck.</p>
<p>Worldwide backlash, hubris shatters Olympic hopefuls' dreams and now, no American cars on the top 10 list. It's Rome all over again, baby.</p>
