<p>This one is not what you think.</p>
<p>"Vacation at my <a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/lgi/bar/135710649.html">house in the hamptons</a> in exchange for....</p>
<p>What I'm looking for in exchange: <br />
I need alot of tools such as a dewalt miter saw, good lawnmower, snowblower, chainsaw, leaf blower, floor sanding equipment, electronics, televisions, surround sound systems, etc..."</p>
<p>Tools for tools. Sounds like a sensible exchange.</p>
<p>This one is exactly what you think.</p>
<p>
1 bedroom apartment available for <a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/bar/135775976.html">that friendly sexy female</a>. Am open to sugesstions.<br />
[sic]. </p>
<p>May we suggest you move out? Second suggestion: using spellcheck is your first step to finding true love. </p>
<blockquote><p>
I have some Sephora and Toy r us gift card I didn't need and I am looking for <a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/bar/135628263.html">Pediasure vanilla w/ fiber</a> ASAP. I am willing to pick it up.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Some serious niche bartering there. That niche being the higly desirable "Procrastinating, Niggardly, Superficial Moms With Incontinent Children." </p>
<p>Ok, that was mean. Oh well.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/bar/135514747.html">Razor "TRIKKE" scooter<br />
</a><br />
I spent $100 to buy this for my daughter...she rode it twice and was not interested.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course she wasn<br />
t interested. Those things suck. Get a skateboard like a normal hooligan, you precious snit.</p>
<p>Ok, someone please parse the hidden meaning in this post. We<br />
re sure it's there but we keep nodding off...</p>
<blockquote><p>
Insomniac Seeks Other Insomniac to <a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/bar/135352778.html">put them to Sleep</a>.</p>
<p>I have a gift to making people fall asleep at any time. <br />
I am looking for a female insomniac to work with. <br />
I promise you I will take you on a mind trip around the world and beyond- you will not be able to keep your eyes open after 1 hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, a clueless yet earnest female college grad is the winner of today's most pathetic barter. Her desperate, misguided plea and our depraved indifference...after the jump.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/bar/135340924.html">I am in need of contact information...</a></p>
<p>I am looking for a job. I am a recent college grad with some experience in editing and writing as well as working at a health clinic for women; counseling them, answering phones and helping with lab work. </p>
<p>Ideally, I would like a job at a non profit organization where I can directly serve people in need or put my writing skills to work. I have a strong interest in women's issues as well as all human rights issues and the environment. </p>
<p>I am also interested in working for a newspaper or magazine. I am basically in search of an entry level position that would allow me to improve my skills and learn new ones. If you know anyone who might be looking for a job candidate like myself, I would greatly appreciate it if there is any way you could put me in touch with them. </p>
<p>In return I can offer you a 5 disk sony cd changer, or my time to help you get something done, or a womens leather jacket or possibly something else we could negotiate over. </p>
<p>Thank you in advance </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll take your 5 disk sony cd changer in exchange for our contact at the Breakaway Bike Messenger agency. Maybe in that position you'll learn something your college never taught you: how the real world works.</p>
