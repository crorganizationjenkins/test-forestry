<p>&bull; We're unsure how the NYC transit strike can make us late to work when we work from home, but by god we've managed to do it. In celebration, have a full-blown computer for $250, after multiple rebates. <a href="http://slickdeals.net/#p6860">Slickdeals</a> has the details.</p>
<p>&bull; Or if you're ready to cast off the Windows hegemony for a smaller, quieter hegemony, Amazon is selling the slower Mac mini for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009U7Y32/ref=nosim/002-2776641-2416065?n=541966">$470</a> after a $25 mail-in rebate. Not a great deal, but getting a good deal on a new Mac is rare, because Apple controls the supply chain.</p>
<p>&bull; If you're a New Yorker forced to work from home today, think about how much more enjoyable it would be with two foot of monitor in front of your face. Dell's <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=dhs&cs=19&sku=24053YR">Ultrasharp 2405FPW 24-inch widescreen LCD</a> is back on sale for just $900. Or, wait for the upcoming 30-inch model with HDCP.</p>
<p>&bull; Woot's deal of the day is gone. It was a baby turtle in a jar of honey. Those go crazy fast.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.ecost.com/ecost/shop/detail.asp?DPNo=668513&wt.mc_id=EWB08409&adcampaign=email,EWB08409">Basic red Roomba for $100</a>. Ours is broken, so we're a little upset with them, but otherwise we're sort of in love with our little hairy robot.</p>
