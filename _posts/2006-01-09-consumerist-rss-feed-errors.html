excerpt: Thanks to everyone who noted problems with the RSS feed and permalinks, which
  for a mysterious reason impervious to our scrying are redirecting to Gawker.com.
  We are working to address the issue and will fix it as soon as we can give the hamsters
  a nice long soak in the hot tub.

<p>If you are reading this via the RSS feed, we guess that means we fixed it.</p>
