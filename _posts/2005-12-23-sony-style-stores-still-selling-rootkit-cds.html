<p>Pete L tells us about Sony's latest blunder in this whole rootkit fiasco. Apparently Sony Style is still selling the infected CDs.<br />
<blockquote>I just got back from the Sony Style store in the Westchester mall, (White Plains, NY) and I saw that the had many CDs in the shelves that had the XCP rootkits.<br />
I asked the manager about this and they said they were, and I quote, "still allowed to sell them". </p></blockquote>
<p>From Sony's website (http://cp.sonybmg.com/xcp/) "2. SONY BMG is working with its retail partners to withdraw compact discs with XCP software from distribution and retail chains. It has asked retailers to cease sale of those discs and to return them to SONY BMG. This withdrawal program has been and is being widely communicated."</p>
<p>I guess it asked 3rd party retailers to return the CDs to Sony so they can sell them in their own stores?<br />
Bah humbug, Sony!</p>
