excerpt: There's not yet many stories on Trembicky.com, a site that chronicles "bad
  landlords we have known," but we see a kindred spirit. You might remember the name
  'Trembicky' from the story "'Gloria Trembicky is a Bad Landlord.'" Inspired by the
  success of that complaint, Trembicky.com takes its name from the landlord who first
  terrorized the site's creators.

<p>There's not yet many stories on <a href="http://trembicky.com">Trembicky.com</a>, a site that chronicles "bad landlords we have known," but we see a kindred spirit. You might remember the name 'Trembicky' from the story "<a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/rental/gloria-trembicky-is-a-bad-landlord-149237.php">'Gloria Trembicky is a Bad Landlord.'</a>" Inspired by the success of that complaint, Trembicky.com takes its name from the landlord who first terrorized the site's creators.</p>
<p>While we certainly welcome your complaints about landlords, as well, we also know what it's like to try and get a new site off the ground. If you've got a hairy tale of rental gone bad, why don't you drop them a line.</p>
<p>And a word of advice to bad landlords everywhere: Be sure to register your vanity domain <i>before</i> you start being a scum bag, lest it become the property of those who hate you.</p>
