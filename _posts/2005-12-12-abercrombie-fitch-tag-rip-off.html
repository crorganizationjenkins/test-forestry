excerpt: If there's one thing we can all agree on, it's that those little fuckers
  at Abercrombie and Fitch should be hung by their charm bracelets and have all the
  faux gay overtone spanked out of them. (Actually, that sounds sort of hot.)The clerk
  had put them on the table behind him, so he turned his back to me for a minute,
  then said, "No, they're $44.95." When I had handed them to him, the store tag had
  a printed price (on the little perforated strip at the bottom) that said $39.50.
  Now the tag was gone. I told him to hang on a second and went back to check the
  display.It's a freakout at the Fitch when prices vary.

<p>It's a freakout at the Fitch when prices <i>vary</i>.</p>
<p>But it makes us wonder a real, science question: Does having the wrong price tag on something <i>really</i> mean a retailer has to sell it to you at that price? We were under the impression that price mistakes, while often honored, were at the store's discretion. (Tearing off tags to cover up a mistake, though, is terribly lame.)</p>
