<p>Despite being outed <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/advertising/cloaked-client-behind-pherotones-revealed-154720.php">on The Consumerist</a> and on at least <a href="http://www.adrants.com/2006/01/mckinney-silver-behind-pherotones-viral.php">one</a> of the very blogs it advertises on, the Pherotones campaign continues, oblvious to its irrelevance.</p>
<p>Pherotones is fake blog specific campaign where a Dr. Myra Vanderhood was advertised as having discovered ringtones that act like pheromones. It was revealed to be a "sneaky" promo for a cell phone content site.</p>
<p>Now the doctor <a href="http://www.pherotones.com/">offers</a> a "$6900.69 Research Grant" to people who submit videos "documenting" pherotones in action.</p>
<p>The marketing initiative is as clever as ducking your credit card bills by changing your address to one in Alaska, but hey, sixty-nine hundred dollars and sixty-nine cents is still sixty-nine hundred dollars and sixty-nine cents.</p>
