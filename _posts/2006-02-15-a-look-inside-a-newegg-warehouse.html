excerpt: Nerd nexus Anandtech.com has a look inside one of Newegg's shipping and distribution
  centers, made especially interesting considering how consistently the online electronics
  retail giant is able to quickly put product in shoppers' hands. Newegg is said to
  have an internal goal of getting every order into customers' hands two days after
  they order onlineâ€”no matter what method of shipping is chosen. In our experience,
  they hit that target more often than not.

<p>Nerd nexus Anandtech.com has a look inside one of Newegg's shipping and distribution centers, made especially interesting considering how consistently the online electronics retail giant is able to quickly put product in shoppers' hands. Newegg is said to have an internal goal of getting every order into customers' hands two days after they order online&mdash;no matter what method of shipping is chosen. In our experience, they hit that target more often than not.</p>
<p>If you're not terribly interested in what makes the supply chain clank inside one of Newegg's many distribution centers, the dozens of pictures of things like giant, multi-uddered packing peanut guns will probably not be for you.</p>
