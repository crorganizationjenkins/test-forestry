excerpt: " The nearly once-a-year savings for frames and glasses are here. They're
  $99 at Sears Optical, along with $100 and under frame, until Feb 18 and $96 at JC
  Penney Optical, along with $150 and under frames until Feb 26. However, some people
  look unfavorably on budget Sears and J.C. Penney eyewear, a phenomenon known as
  department store stigmatism."
