excerpt: 'Although we can think of few things more appealing than leaving a child
  to hang in an elastic death trap, we must avoid the Bounce Bounce Baby! Door jumper,
  despite its potential for comedy. It seems the jumper is a "Hazard: The plastic
  clamp that attaches the jumper seat to a door frame can break, which can cause the
  unit and child to fall to the floor. This poses an injury hazard to young children."'

<p>Although we can think of few things more appealing than leaving a child to hang in an elastic death trap, we must avoid the <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml06/06051.html">Bounce Bounce Baby! Door jumper</a>, despite its potential for comedy. It seems the jumper is a "Hazard: The plastic clamp that attaches the jumper seat to a door frame can break, which can cause the unit and child to fall to the floor. This poses an injury hazard to young children."</p>
<p>If you're going to hang your precious pumpkin from a door frame, please, do it the old fashioned way. Salt liberally and bind with baling twine for one long-lasting childhood.</p>
