<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/billgatesipod.jpg"></a>A couple weeks ago, we posted a video that has been taking the Internet by storm: <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/advertising/what-if-microsoft-designed-the-ipod-box-157643.php">What If Microsoft Designed The iPod Box?</a> At the time, we wondered about the funny guys who'd so perfectly hoisted Microsoft's petard.</p>
<p>Update! We now know who created the video... it was apparently Microsoft themselves. Quoth Tom Pilla, Microsoft spokesman: "It was an internal-only video clip commissioned by our packaging [team] to humorously highlight the challenges we have faced RE: packaging and to educate marketers here about the pitfalls of packaging/branding."</p>
<p>Well, mission accomplished, Tom! We're not sure if Tom's claims are true as to the intent of the video &mdash; it could just have easily been created internally by a marketer frustrated by the status-quo at Microsoft of confusing naming paradigms and obfuscating product design. Still, no reason not to take them at their word, and we hope this heralds in a more zen-like age of marketing for Microsoft. They definitely could learn a lot from Apple.</p>
