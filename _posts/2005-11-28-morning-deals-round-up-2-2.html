<p>&bull; Sometimes the simple deals are the sweetest: Use the code "EM21HL30" for 30% off for purchases at <a href="http://footlocker.com">FootLocker.com</a>, <i>including gift cards</i>. [via <a href="http://slickdeals.net/#p6758">Slickdeals</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot</a>: Advent ADVW791 900Mhz Wireless Headphones for $45, shipped. We say: pass.</p>
<p>&bull; FANTOM 300GB 3.5" External USB 2.0 Hard Drive for <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822204001&ATT=Hard+Drives+External&CMP=OTC-pr1c3grabb3r&srccode=cii_5784816&cpncode=10-13302573-2">$120 + $7 shipping</a>, after $20 rebate. We prefer FireWire hard drives, but if you just need some extra dumb storage, that's not a bad price at all.</p>
<p>&bull; SanDisk 1GB Memory Stick Pro Duo for <a href="http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=10388963&adid=17662">$50 shipped after $20 rebate</a>. Yes, this is what you want for your PSP, and it's in stock and ships free. It's a hot price&mdash;today's the last day.</p>
<p>&bull; KitchenAid Onyx Black 12-Cup 700 Watt Ultra Wide Mouth Food Processor for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BV6BWO/103-3480039-1119032?v=glance&n=284507">$140 shipped</a>. It may not be as sexy as the stand mixer, but it's hard to argue with 700 watts of triple-disced shredding action. Try coupon "HOHOHOHO" for possible additional discount.</p>
