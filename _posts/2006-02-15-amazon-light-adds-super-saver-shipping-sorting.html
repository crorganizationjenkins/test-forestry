excerpt: Alan Taylor, creator of the award-winning Amazon Light Four front-end, has
  built a new version called... 'Amazon Light.' (Version 4 still exists, should you
  prefer that interface.) The biggest new improvement as far as we're concerned is
  the ability for Amazon Light to tell you instantly whether or not an item qualifies
  for free Super Saving shipping and Amazon Primeâ€”a feature often requested by Amazon
  customers but that has never been built into the interface, likely for fear of pissing
  off third-party retailers.

<p>For those of us who use Amazon Prime, however, the new Amazon Light is a god send. (We accidentally typed 'god spend,' but that's far too witty for us this morning.)</p>
