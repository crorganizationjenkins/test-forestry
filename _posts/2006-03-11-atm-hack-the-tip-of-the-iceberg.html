<p>Two stories giving some perspective on the ATM break:</p>
<p>A security analyst <a href="http://www.silicon.com/financialservices/0,3800010322,39157105,00.htm">says</a>, "What's really exposed are the retail systems that use the ATM system. It could have been an insider<br />
 it's very hard to know. It was someone who had access to the [encryption] keys data. They were very skilled."</p>
<p>"The analyst said the crime reflects the largest PIN theft to date and the financial industry will be hit by more PIN-block fraud in the future," writes <em>Consumerist</em> reader Brian.</p>
<p><img alt="aviv.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/aviv.jpg" width="80" class="right-img" height="100" />"But Citibank is only the tip of the iceberg," said Avivah Litan (pictured), a Gartner research vice president and apparently, the only person who knows anything and can talk to the press, "The scam -- and scandal -- has hit national banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Washington Mutual, as well as smaller banks, including ones in Oregon, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, all of which have re-issued debit cards in recent weeks."</p>
<p>"This is the worst hack ever," Litan maintained. "It's significant because not only is it a really wide-spread breach, but it affects debit cards, which everyone thought were immune to these kinds of things."</p>
<p>PIN block hacks are this year's phishing.</p>
