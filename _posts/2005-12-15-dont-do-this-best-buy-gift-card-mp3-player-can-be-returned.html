excerpt: 'Reader "C" writes:Suggestion: You mentioned that Best Buy was selling non-ipod
  MP3 players and offering a $50 gift card to boot. [We mentioned that here. -Ed.]
  I bought one and then found out the person I bought it for had just that day got
  one. So I returned it. Which left me with the $50 gift card. It puts me in a bit
  of an ethical bind as I''m not sure whether or not that''s stealing. But the less
  ethically challenged might want to think about doing that. Or that may be a bit
  beyond suggestions you are willing to make.Yes. That''s going a bit far, even for
  us.'
