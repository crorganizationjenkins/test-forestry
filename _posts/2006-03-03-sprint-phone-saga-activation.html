excerpt: 'We called to activate our new Sprint phone. '
---
<p>We called to activate our new Sprint phone. </p>
<p>After punching in a few numbers, the automated voice response system said, "Oh, I see you have a corporate account. Please hold as I connect you to a representative," somehow managing to sound obsequious and deferential.</p>
<p>We chatted with the friendly customer service rep. "Hm," she said, "we sent those out pre-activated." Lo and behold, it was.</p>
<p>Sprint totally tagged the phone for executive lunchtime backrub treatment. </p>
