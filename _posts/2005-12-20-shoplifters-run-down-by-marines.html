<p>Two lessons to be learned from <a href="http://www.nbc-2.com/articles/readarticle.asp?articleid=5247&z=3&p=">this story</a> about shoplifters in Ft. Myers, Florida.</p>
<p>1. There are special bags called 'boosters' that are lined with a material that prevents security sensors from being activated by stolen goods&mdash;at least according to the police in the NBC-2 News article.</p>
<p>2. If one is to shoplift using a booster, do not do it near a couple of young buck marines, because they will run you down.<br />
<blockquote>Beltran made it past two Lee County deputies and mall security. But as he crossed U.S. 41, he met his match.<br />
"We saw officers chasing him so we took off after the guy because the officer was far behind," said Private Ryan Pitts of the U.S. Marine Corps.</p></blockquote>
