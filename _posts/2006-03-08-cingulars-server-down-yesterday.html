<p>Looks like yesterday's Cingular dropouts may have been due to a faulty server which had to get a bobby pin inserted into a small recessed button on the backside.</p>
<p>Here's an email intercepted by a municipal telephony manager:</p>

<p>Update!</p>
<p>Cingular has given an ETR of 30 to 60 minutes. One of their servers<br />
has been identified as the problem and is in the process of being reset.</p>

<p>DoITT licenses the Cingular franchise in the NY area. </p>
<p>About half of New York City's official municipal communication devices run on Cingular/AT&T. Good thing there wasn't like, any emergency going on or anything.</p>
