excerpt: A pal of head BoingBoinger Mark has stumbled across an unbelievable $2.49
  per file 'virus scanning' charge levied by Staples when customers bring in documents
  to be printed. Another former Staples employee writes in to say that the fee is
  more of a document handling type of thing, with an initial $2.49 plus $99 per file
  charge, just because it's more of a pain to deal with files than to copy something
  from paper to paper.
