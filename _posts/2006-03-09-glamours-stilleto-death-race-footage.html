<p>Here's video of Glamour Mag's stiletto-on-cobblestones race held this morning, <a href="http://www.gawker.com/news/video/dutch-glamour-death-match-lacks-death-159406.php">courtesy</a> of Gawker.</p>
<p>Only 150 entrants were allowed. All had to be women (no trannies) sporting a copy of Glamour's March fashion issue and wearing stilettos with heels at least 7 cm high, and at most 1.5 cm wide. Nancy Kwam, a 20 year-old journalism student, won. She's uncertain where she'll spend the<br />
 10,000 but supposes it will be a little something to add to the Chanel glasses, Gucci collar and Armani suit she raced in.</p>
<p>Alas, there was no death in the Dutch Glamour magazine high-heel death race. Nor twisted ankles. But, oh yes, copious amounts of glamour! And even--glamor! </p>
