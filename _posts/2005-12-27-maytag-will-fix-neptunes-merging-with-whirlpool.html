<p>We <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/complaints/consumers-speak-bob-bought-three-bombs-143877.php">recall</a> hearing that a couple of you folks bought the Maytag Neptune front-loading washer and were less than enthused about the product. Well, we've got some good and bad news for you.</p>
<p>On the upside, there was a class action lawsuit that was settled in your favor, making it possible for you to have your Neptune repaired&mdash;including that fetid, molding gasket. We'd suggest heading over to the <a href="http://maytagfrontloadsettlement.com/">settlement site</a> to determine what you need to do to get your electric warsh tub fixed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the future, it would appear that Maytag is going to <a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2005/maytag04.html">merge with Whirlpool</a>. That might improve Maytag's bad quality issues of late, since many have recommended Whirlpool units over their Maytag equivilents, but it's possible that the Maytag acquisition could drag Whirlpool's quality down. Time will tell.</p>
<p><i>Update: A call to the Maytag customer care center has clarified the confusing wording of the settlement site. In short, if you haven't already filed a claim with Maytag about your Neptune, you're up a creek. Sorry.</i></p>
