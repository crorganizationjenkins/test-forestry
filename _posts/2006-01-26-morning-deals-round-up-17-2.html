excerpt: "â€¢ Amazon is taking pre-orders for the iRobot Scooba, the floor-washing counterpart
  to the Roomba, for $400. We are unduly excited about this product, but we really
  recommend waiting until some reviews come out before dropping four bills. There
  is also some question as to whether or not a Scooba owner will be tied to purchasing
  only the Clorox-branded cleaning solution, or if something can be whipped up at
  home. But still, new robot! Coupon code JANCLEAR takes off $25."

<p>&bull; Amazon is taking pre-orders for the iRobot Scooba, the floor-washing counterpart to the Roomba, for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DN7CD2/ref=nosim/102-0392434-9450502?n=284507">$400</a>. We are unduly excited about this product, but we really recommend waiting until some reviews come out before dropping four bills. There is also some question as to whether or not a Scooba owner will be tied to purchasing only the Clorox-branded cleaning solution, or if something can be whipped up at home. But still, new robot! Coupon code <b>JANCLEAR</b> takes off $25.</p>
<p>&bull; We've yet to see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CZ0PT4/ref=nosim/102-0392434-9450502?n=130">Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</a>, but we're sure it's up to the embarassingly high standards of previous Aardman films. Pre-order today at Amazon for $16.</p>
<p>&bull; And just in time for the holidays, DeepDiscountDVD.com has <a href="http://www.deepdiscountdvd.com/dvd.cfm?itemid=COL005816&promotion=y"><i>Groundhog Day</i> Special Edition</a> on sale for $9.42, shipped. It is perhaps the greatest story ever told.</p>
<p>&bull; GoldenGadgets.com has <a href="http://www.goldengadgets.com/">what appears to be a sale on LED-based flashlights</a>, with simple 14-element White LED models going for as low as $5. [via <a href="http://bensbargains.net">BensBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; OnSale.com has the Triton <a href="http://www.onsale.com/onsale/shop/detail.asp?dpno=699928&store=onsale&source=BWBCJ&adcampaign=email,BWBCJ&wt.mc_id=BWBCJ">Venture Light Backpack</a> for $30&mdash;but free after a <a href="http://image1.cc-inc.com/rapcoupons/6621onsale.pdf">$30 mail-in rebate</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; The Home Depot has a <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/prel80/HDUS/EN_US/diy_main/pg_diy.jsp?CNTTYPE=PROD_META&CNTKEY=misc/searchResults.jsp&N=2984%204233&BV_SessionID=@@@@1880416697.1138276556@@@@&BV_EngineID=cccladdglfjmmekcgelceffdfgidgln.0&cm_ven=CJ&cm_cat=1066642&cm_ite=Save+50%25+on+select+lighting+%26+fans+AND+FREE+SHIPPING+too+at+%22+&cm_pla=227502&aid=10412770&pid=227502&cj=1">50% off sale on sale lights and ceiling fans</a>. (It looks like just fixtures that are hung, but we didn't get too in depth as we won't be buying fixtures until we find a new place to live.)</p>
<p>&bull; eCost has the <a href="http://www.ecost.com/ecost/shop/detail.asp?store=ecost&source=ECOSTCJ&dpno=669742&adcampaign=email,ECOSTCJ">Nintendo DS refurbished</a> for $99 plus shipping. That's an okay deal, but remember that the new bundles now include copies of <i>Mario Kart</i>, so it's really up to you. [via <a href="http://techbargains.com">TechBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; We're kicking ourselves over today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a>, the Gyration ULTRA cordless optical mouse, because we were up an hour ago and probably could have snagged it. Oh well&mdash;new models are on the way and are <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/ces/live-from-ces-thomson-mobile-gyration-remotes-pt-1-146794.php">even smaller</a>.</p>
