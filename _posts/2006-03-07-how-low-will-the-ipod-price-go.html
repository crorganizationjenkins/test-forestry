<p>How much cheaper are these dang iPods gonna get? <br />
Find out after the jump.</p>
<p>First, a chart detailing each generation of iPod with its price, size and cost per gig.</p>

<p>Next, a graph.</p>

<p>Now, you solve the math problem. Based on the information above, how many gigs will gen 6 hold, what is its price point and cost per gig? </p>
<p>Yes, graphing calculators and any study materials you may have brought with you are allowed. </p>
