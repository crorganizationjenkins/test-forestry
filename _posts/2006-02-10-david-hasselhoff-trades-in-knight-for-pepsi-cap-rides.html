excerpt: How do you like your Pepsi-Cola? How about David Hasselhoff? This asexually
  lascivious image leered at Flickr user 'Downunder Dan' from atop an Australian billboard
  and he was compelled to share it with us. Thanks, Dan! Now we can gouge our eyes
  out in peace and replace them with K.I.T.T's array of futuristic crime sensors.
