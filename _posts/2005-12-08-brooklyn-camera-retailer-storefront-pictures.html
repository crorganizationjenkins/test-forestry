excerpt: Even before The Thomas Hawk Affair with PriceRitePhoto, The Consumerist was
  preoccupied with the phenomenon of Brooklyn-based camera stores. For one, we live
  in Brooklyn. For two, we recently purchased a camera and did much comparison shopping

<p>Even before <a href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/complaints/priceritephoto-want-to-cancel-your-order-well-sue-140203.php">The Thomas Hawk Affair</a> with PriceRitePhoto, The Consumerist was preoccupied with the phenomenon of Brooklyn-based camera stores. For one, we live in Brooklyn. For two, we recently purchased a camera and did much comparison shopping beforehand.</p>
<p>We wish we would have then been privy to this <i>brilliant</i> picture archive compiled by Don Wiss, showing the <a href="http://donwiss.com/pictures/BrooklynStores/">storefronts of dozens of online camera retailers</a>. Not only do we happen to find mundane New York storefronts interesting in and of themselves, but are also aghast that there is a grey market store called 'Radio Active Electronics' that we have not had the pleasure to be fleeced in.</p>
<p>As always, thanks to this peculiar breed of scammers, avoid discount camera dealers at almost all cost. (<i>Thanks, Galen!</i>)</p>
