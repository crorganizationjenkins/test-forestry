excerpt: We're not quite sure what this "anti-advergame" from MolleIndustria is supposed
  to be teaching us, but here's what we learned:Running a profitable, multinational
  corporation takes a lot of hard work and skill.Hippie, iMac-using, pot-smoking kids
  don't respond well to our clown-themed marketing.It's fun to incinerate cows with
  a flamethrowing robot.We could really go for a burger today.

<p>We're not quite sure what this "anti-advergame" from <a href="http://www.molleindustria.it/">MolleIndustria</a> is supposed to be teaching us, but here's what we learned:

<li>Running a profitable, multinational corporation takes a lot of hard work and skill.</li>
<li>Hippie, iMac-using, pot-smoking kids don't respond well to our clown-themed marketing.</li>
<li>It's fun to incinerate cows with a flamethrowing robot.</li>
<li>We could really go for a burger today.</li>
</ul>
<p>Way to go, Italian anti-McDonald's graphic artists! You've given us all a little more respect for the arduous balancing act that it takes to provide us with tasty hamburger-like products.</p>
