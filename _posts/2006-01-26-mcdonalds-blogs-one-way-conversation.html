excerpt: After hearing about the blood-topped sundaes allegations at McDonalds, we
  thought we'd contact Bob Langert, McDonald's Senior Director for Corporate Responsibility,
  who also posts to the company's new Corporate Responsibility Blog, to encourage
  him to post about the issue. Unfortunately, despite a stated desire to "hear from
  you because we are always learning and trying to improve," McDonald's blog doesn't
  have a way to actually contact Mr. Langert listed on the blog itself.

<p>After hearing about the <a href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/fast-food/mcdonalds-tops-sundaes-with-human-blood-150693.php">blood-topped sundaes</a> allegations at McDonalds, we thought we'd contact Bob Langert, McDonald's Senior Director for Corporate Responsibility, who also posts to the company's new <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/pr/mcdonalds-starts-corporate-responsibility-blog-150403.php">Corporate Responsibility Blog</a>, to encourage him to post about the issue. Unfortunately, despite a stated desire to "<a href="http://csr.blogs.mcdonalds.com/default.asp?mode=author">hear from you because we are always learning and trying to improve,</a>" McDonald's blog doesn't have a way to actually contact Mr. Langert listed on the blog itself.</p>
<p>We suppose we could leave a comment in the <a href="http://csr.blogs.mcdonalds.com/default.asp?item=124518">single post</a> that has been made on the blog (and we have), as the comments are vetted by the author. We encourage Mr. Langert to add some methods for the blog-reading public to actually initiate conversation.</p>
<p>But first, maybe he should talk to us about those sundaes. (Bloody sundaes.)</p>
