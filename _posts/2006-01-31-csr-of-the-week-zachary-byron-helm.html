<p>We are delighted to have been contacted by Zachary Byron Helm [pictured], the mohawked warrior of T-Mobile's customer service, whose picture we <a href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/customer-service/at-the-other-end-of-the-line-purported-tmobile-edition-150843.php">posted just last week</a>.</p>
<p>He writes: "<i>You recently posted a picture of a T-mobile employee ... it is in fact a legitimate photo. I was a team lead at teh Thornton Colorado call center, which is a churched up term for "General crap-on, not quite a supervisor yet personel" which also means you get to do all the fun stuff a supervisor doesn't actually want to do such as taking calls wherein someone requests a member of management.</i>"</p>
<p>It saddens us to know that Mr. Byron Helm seems to no longer be employed by T-Mobile, as his appearance gave the first sign of personality the tight-jawed company desperately needed. Nevertheless, Zachary, we salute your good nature and officially crown you <i>The Consumerist's CSR of the Week</i>. May the road rise up to meet your hearse, and may the wind be always simultaneously to your right and left.</p>
