<p>&bull; Kiss the pan! Amazon is selling both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008CM6B/103-3480039-1119032?n=284507">5 1/2-quart</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008CM6H/103-3480039-1119032?n=284507">3 1/2-quart</a> Cuisinart Chef's Saut&eacute; pan for $40 and $30, respectively.

The leather satchel is a good deal at $600, but the colors are out of season (kind of like Prada handbags).</p>
