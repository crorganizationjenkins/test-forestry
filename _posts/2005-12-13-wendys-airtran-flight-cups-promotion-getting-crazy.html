excerpt: It looks like we're not the only ones to notice the frenzy growing around
  AirTran and Wendy's Free Flight Giveaway. The Christian Science Monitor reports
  on dumpster divers digging outside Manhattan Wendy's looking for the cups that will
  gain them a free trip.In all, the pair collected about 330 cups, more than enough
  for two round-trip flights for each of them. "It's pretty disgusting work, especially
  when you grab a handful of chewed meat," says Danielle, who asked that her full
  name be withheld to ensure that AirTran would honor her claim. "But it's about the
  only way I can afford to see my family [in San Luis Obispo, Calif.]."It's getting
  nuts. The article quotes the going rate for a single ticket as going for a buck
  fiftyâ€”more than it costs to buy the cup with soda at Wendy's. People are literally
  being paid to dumpster dive.

<p>It's been a few years since we traipsed in the greasy backs of fast food alleys, so we may be out of practice. Getting a $700 round-trip ticket for just a couple hours of digging almost sounds worth the trouble. Have any of you make a fortune digging through Wendy's trash yet? (<i>Thanks, Ryan!</i>)</p>
