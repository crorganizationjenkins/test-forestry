<p>We hate ads but we dare you to hate this Nike soccer campaign.</p>

<p>Eric Cantona, an awesome soccer player who left the sport at his peak a decade ago to pursue a mediocre acting career, bursts into a German TV Station and exhorts us to make the game beautiful again. Down with ugly soccer, he proclaims, espousing a need to return the game to skill, heart, honor, and joy.</p>
<p>The ad, along with five forthcoming others, are hosted on a webpage with just one Nike logo and a URL prefixed by the company name. Other than that, no finger smashing brand message.</p>
<p>Thanks for not treating us like<br />
tards. </p>
<p>Not that we<br />
re going to buy your shoes. There<br />
s still that awful swoosh on them. And Adidas totally owns on the field.</p>
