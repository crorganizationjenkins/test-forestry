excerpt: "• Today's Woot! is a Denon S-101 DVD Entertainment System with iPod compatibility
  for $705, shipped. That's a good price—they normally go for $900 or more—but we
  can't help but think that for most folks, a nice DVD player and a set of surround
  sound speakers and receiver might be a better value, even without the ability to
  charge an iPod."
