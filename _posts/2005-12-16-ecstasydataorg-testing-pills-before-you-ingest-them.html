excerpt: Shopping for real ecstasy is such a choreâ€”especially since so much of the
  stuff isn't really MDMA, the magical methylenedioxymethamphetamine that makes the
  world go snuggly. Used to be, one could just pop over to EcstasyData.org and see
  if they'd run a test on a pill from your batch. If your pill had more random junk
  druggery than MDMA, you'd then know to take two. (We kid, unless it was also filled
  with ketamine, which is awesome.)

<p>Shopping for real ecstasy is such a chore&mdash;especially since so much of the stuff isn't really MDMA, the magical methylenedioxymethamphetamine that makes the world go snuggly. Used to be, one could just pop over to <a href="http://ecstacydata.org">EcstasyData.org</a> and see if they'd run a test on a pill from your batch. If your pill had more random junk druggery than MDMA, you'd then know to take two. (We kid, unless it was also filled with ketamine, which is awesome.)</p>
<p>Sadly, as of August 1st, the Ecstasy Testing Project is out of funds, and any new testing must be paid for by the pill submitter at $115 a pop. They are soliciting a grant to repotentiate the project, but for now it has mellowed, with only two pills tested this month.</p>
