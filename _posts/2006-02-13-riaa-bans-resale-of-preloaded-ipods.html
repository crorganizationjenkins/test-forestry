s legal strong-arm, announced to MTV.com last Friday that reselling iPods with preloaded music is<br />
a clear violation of U.S. copyright law. The RIAA is monitoring this means of infringement.<br />
 Apparently 1) the RIAA is now a legislative body and 2) MTV is still relevant.</p>
<p>An Ebayer of video iPods packed with 6000+ songs has already been contacted by RIAA agents dispatched via black vinyl choppers pumping<br />
Grindin'<br />
 by Clipse.</p>
<p>This brings to mind "dynamic" and "static" systems, as elucidated by Joseph Schumpeter in his lectures on<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415158680/sr=8-18/qid=1139845073/ref=sr_1_18/002-2707453-1562404?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Evolutionary Economics and Creative Destruction</a>.<br />
 Or at least that's what we glean based on the book summary.</p>
<p>A static system is one requiring lots of effort to maintain, like a boulder held to a cliff. A dynamic system trends towards equilibrium, like a boulder in a really giant bowl. In vain, the RIAA maintains a static system. It will fall like a Berlin wall. The only question is when and how to make it into a sweet t-shirt. </p>
