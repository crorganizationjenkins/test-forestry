excerpt: One of the oft-stated consumer worries post-Katrina—besides the trepidation
  of a regional shortage in poor, underserved New Orleanians to clean up the beads
  and offal of exploded Mardi Gras tourists—was a fear that coffee prices would spike.
  A large portion of our coffee enters the country through New Orleans, which is why
  companies like Folgers put over half of their coffee production plants in the city.

<p>One of the oft-stated consumer worries post-Katrina&mdash;besides the trepidation of a regional shortage in poor, underserved New Orleanians to clean up the beads and offal of exploded Mardi Gras tourists&mdash;was a fear that coffee prices would spike. A large portion of our coffee enters the country through New Orleans, which is why companies like Folgers put over half of their coffee production plants in the city.</p>
<p>But to paraphrase the great economist Milt Friedman, when your swamp-based coffee production facilities flood, sometimes you're gonna get a few turtles. That's why The Consumerist was not surprised that Marjorie Morris found a dead baby turtle in her can of Folgers' coffee.<br />
<blockquote>After removing what looked like a block of condensed coffee, Morris shook off the coffee grains and discovered a dead baby turtle about two inches in diameter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, it looks like a snapper, which is one of our favorite kinds of turtles. If The Consumerist needed a mascot, this desiccated reptile would surely be it.</p>
<p>Morris is not planning on suing Folgers, despite the initial response she receive from the company.<br />
<blockquote>"(The customer service representative) tried to pass it off as though it's nothing unusual. ... It seemed like they had similar things happen (before)," she said.</p></blockquote>
<p>What's the strangest thing have you found in your retail products?</p>
