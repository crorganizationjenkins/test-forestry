<p>You might feel guilty from buying from anything but the most independent of retailers. If you have fallen sway to the charms of big box stores, Cambridge bookstore Lorem Ipsum is offering 'Bookstore Indulgences' to assuage your guilt, complete with quasi-official <i>Catholicy</i> font. By purchasing these indulgences, you give the bookstore free money&mdash;and they forgive you.</p>
<p>These indulgences, like their religious precursor of old, cost actual money&mdash;$50 buys $100 worth of guilt-cleansing; $100 buy $200; and so on. So while we appreciate the wink and half of the nod, if any of you actually pay real money to purchase one of these items, we will be beating you with one fist while rapidly throwing together our own web form with the other. (<i>Thanks, FMA!</i>)</p>
