<p>Do you want to get rich by playing the supply-exploit-demand eBay game on the next big video game console? Did you see those ridiculous $1000 X-Box 360 eBay auctions and think, "Man, I wish I could get in on some of <em>that</em> exploitive action?" Your prayers have been answered, because <a href="http://joeceo.blogspot.com/2006/02/how-to-make-killing-with-ps3-ebay.html">this blog has a remarkably sleazy and delusional article up</a> on the fine art of console reselling.</p>
<p>Specifically, he claims that the Playstation 3 video game console is going to be just as profitable (if not <strong>more so</strong>) than the X-Box 360, which is why you should buy, then resell, as many as possible. Here's his argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, on to question 2... will the PS3 launch be the same? Undoubtedly, yes. Sony has learned a lot of lessons from Microsoft with this previous launch, such as how to spin "low inventory levels" into a media PR event. In short, Microsoft gained worldwide publicity from this craziness. Perhaps Microsoft could have met demand and let's assume they did. If everybody was able to walk into a WalMart and buy the XBOX on launch day with no problem, we would not be talking about it now. In fact, nobody besides gamers would even hear about it outside of that first week. However, there was all this news about people camping out, XBOX 360s on eBay for more than $1,000, scam artists selling 'XBOX 360 boxes', etc. that virtually every man, woman and child knew how 'hot' the XBOX 360s were. Do you think your non-gaming neighbor heard about it? You bet they did. And they might even buy one if they saw one on a shelf today.</p></blockquote>
<p>We rarely say this on The Consumerist, but this guy's a farging idiot, and he's about to piss away his X-Box 360 profit on the PS3 launch.</p>
<p>First of all, the scarcity of X-Box 360s at launch was not a public relations triumph for Microsoft: it was a public relations disaster. To date, there are <em>still</em> people who want to buy the console who can't actually buy one. Many of these people preordered the system... in other words, they aren't converts swayed by the blood in the water of the consumerist feeding frenzy that ensued as supply failed to meet demand. That "every man, woman and child" knew about the X-Box 360 doesn't mean they could ever give Microsoft their money. It doesn't take a triple digit intelligence quotient to recognize that if one of your customers can't buy your product, you aren't maximizing your profit, and that publicity means jack squat if no one can buy the product the publicity is about. Furthermore, many people have given up on owning an X-Box 360 entirely who would have gleefully purchased it if it was available on release. Hey, priorities change, the cash surplus you have today gets spent on other things and then you're broke again, or just plain frustrated. Microsoft lost customers over the fiasco.</p>
<p>Sony's stupid - the root kit fiasco proves that plenty. But they aren't stupid enough not to have learned a lesson from Microsoft's misguided race to first in a new console generation. If you buy PS3s for eBay value, you are going to get burned, because Sony is going to try to sell more PS3's in the first month of release than Microsoft managed to supply from date of release to PS3 launch. Sony is not going to give up the mantle of most successful console willingly - they are going to saturate the market with PS3s, because that's the only way they are going to make money off of the software they sell.</p>
<p>Buy a PS3 because you want one. Don't buy it to become a millionaire off of eBay.</p>
