<p>The Ad-Rag advertising blog got white-out slathered on it for posting unauthorized Bic ads.</p>
<p>After posting the mockups, the TBWA ad agency and Bic demanded Ad-Rag remove the images advertising a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-Out">certain brand of corrective fluid</a>. Furthermore, they required the blog to scrub out all mentions of a trademarked brand name from all the posts and <em>even the comments</em>. Full info <a href="http://ad-rag.com/128819.php ">here</a> at Ad-Rag.</p>
<p>More of the offending images which you should steal and spread around the net before we're sued, after the jump...</p>
<p>Creatives will often mock up ads "on spec," that is, speculatively and without being in a client's pay, to try out ideas or demonstrate their skills. Here are three such ads exploring what would happen if we used White-Out on important historical events.</p>
<p><strong>9/11</strong></p>
<p><img alt="btorresgemelas4ts.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/btorresgemelas4ts.jpg" width="450" class="center-img" height="319" /></p>
<p>As commentors and Bic and TBWA later pointed out, this isn't really on-brand for Bic. Ads these days often dramatize one singular product benefit. </p>
<p>
<strong>Saigon</strong></p>
<p><img alt="bsaigon4ig.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bsaigon4ig.jpg" width="450" class="center-img" height="319" /></p>
<p>What's the benefit here? That white-out type products are good for censorship? </p>
<p>
<strong>Ninios</strong></p>
<p><img alt="bninios7op.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bninios7op.jpg" width="320" height="227" /></p>
<p>While visually dramatic and certainly shocking, the ads fail to communicate the product's real power. But we don't think Bic should be so heavy-handed in silencing the fine advertising blog, <a href="http://www.ad-rag.com">Ad-Rag</a>. </p>
<p>Perversely, gagging Ad-Rag enacts the very anti-free-speech associations Bic feared the spec ads created.</p>
