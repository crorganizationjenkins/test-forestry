excerpt: If you've got a few minutes to burn, this Slashdot thread is full of great
  information about the pitfalls of the rebate machineâ€”despite the linked blog post
  on ComputerWorld that attempts to apologize for the fell retail process.

<p>If you've got a few minutes to burn, <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/05/12/02/217252.shtml?tid=98&tid=187&tid=105&tid=159">this Slashdot thread</a> is full of great information about the pitfalls of the rebate machine&mdash;despite the <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/blogs/node/1378">linked blog post on ComputerWorld</a> that attempts to apologize for the fell retail process.</p>
<p>We know that rebates are an unnecessary pitfall of the modern consumer adventure, so we won't go into all the reasons why companies are so fond of them (forced registration of the product which allows companies to avoid the 'no junk mail' regulations is just one example). But we did discover the potentially handy <a href="http://www.rebate-tracker.com/">Rebate-Tracker.com</a>, a site much in the vein of the <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/shophacks/shophackery-never-forget-to-mail-a-rebate-again-140158.php">Backpack shophack</a> that we offered just a couple days back.</p>
<p>We signed up for the site but have not used it for any rebates yet, so your mileage may vary.</p>
