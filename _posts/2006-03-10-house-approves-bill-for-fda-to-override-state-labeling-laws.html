<p>The US House passed allowing the FDA to invalidate state's food and labeling laws if they're stricter than federal standards.</p>
<p>Exemptions could be granted if the Food and Drug Administration determines they are needed and they<br />
would not unduly burden interstate commerce.</p>
<p>We'd hate to think that fully informing customers about a product's contents might unduly inconvenience companies.</p>
