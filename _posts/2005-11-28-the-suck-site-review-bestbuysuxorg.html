excerpt: A classic example of post-Flash minimalism, BestBuySux.org offers customer
  complaints alongside horror stories from employees. Presented in Plainest Textâ„¢,
  BestBuySux.org even has the good grace to offer a "Pro-BB" section, where customers
  and employees can offer a balance to the six years of collected vitriol which is
  indexed month-by-month.

<p>A classic example of post-Flash minimalism, <a href="http://www.bestbuysux.org/">BestBuySux.org</a> offers customer complaints alongside horror stories from employees. Presented in Plainest Text&trade;, BestBuySux.org even has the good grace to offer a "Pro-BB" section, where customers and employees can offer a balance to the six years of collected vitriol which is indexed month-by-month.</p>
<p>Sadly, the few graphical elements take a turn for the puerile. Animated GIF men prance across the screen to urinate on a Best Buy logo, while a waving American flag reminds us that, no matter how poorly big box stores may treat us as shoppers, BestBuySucks.org will <i>always</i> remember 9/11.</p>
<p>The content makes up for the Cyber+Dsign&mdash;almost. We dare anyone to thumb through the <a href="http://www.bestbuysux.org/html/com11-05.html">latest employee complaints</a> without feeling guilty for every toaster and cheap DVD you've ever purchase from the Big Ol' Tag. (And the <i>opposite of guilty</i> for never buying a Product Service Plan ever again.)</p>
<p><i>The Consumerist's Suck Rating: Four Broken Plasma Screens for Content. Two Broken Plasma Screen demerit for animated graphics, for a total of Two (Out of Five).</i></p>
