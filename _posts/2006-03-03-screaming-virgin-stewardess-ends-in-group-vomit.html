The BBC, in its inimitable dry British humor, reports a "Probe Into 'Panicking' Stewardess."</p>
<p>Apparently, a Virgin flight enroute to Las Vegas hit some turbulence and according to businesswoman Claire Daley a stewardess, "screamed every time we dropped and at one point chanted three times 'We're going to crash'."</p>
<p>"It was very, very scary. Most people on that plane thought they were going to die" said Mr Marshall, a 33-year old BBC journalist. Half of the passengers used their barf bags, he added.</p>
