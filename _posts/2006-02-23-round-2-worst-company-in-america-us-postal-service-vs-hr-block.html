<p>"I have heard some real horror stories from people that attempt to get their taxes done there by what I can only assume are chimps in people clothes. I find it especially terrifying because when your taxes get messed up you are being screwes over not once, but twice," said <a href="http://thekilgore.blogspot.com/">Christy</a>, H&R Block submitter.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%26R_Block">Wikipedia H&R Block</a> fun fact: "On November 30, 2004, Ken Jennings lost after winning 74 straight appearance on the national quiz show Jeopardy! when he incorrectly responded "What is FedEx?" instead of "What is H&R Block?" on the Final Jeopardy! clue. The clue read "Most of this firm's 70,000 seasonal white-collar employees work only four months a year." </p>
<p>H&R Block subsequently offered Jennings personal finance and tax preparation services for life."</p>
