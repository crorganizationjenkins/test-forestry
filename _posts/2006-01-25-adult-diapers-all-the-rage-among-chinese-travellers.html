excerpt: 'On the other hand, maybe the Chinese should be censored.Alongside food and
  fire crackers, Chinese are adding a new item to their lunar New Year shopping: Adult
  diapers. Sales have soared ahead of the holiday as travelers prepare for long trips
  home aboard trains so crowded that even the toilets are jammed with people, newspapers
  said Tuesday.Maybe Google''s actually got the right idea here. Do we really want
  to encourage the free exchange of ideas with a people who would find soiling themselves,
  then sitting around in their own filth for a twenty hour train ride, preferable
  to just going in front of someone else? Or, hell, just sticking their ass out the
  window? Can you imagine being one of the few passengers with pride on that cattle
  car, packed in the middle of a thousand peasants happily stewing in their own feces?
  Remind us to link this story next time we complain about Amtrak. God bless America,
  baby.'
