<p>Blizzard has come down hard on a BGLT (bi-sexual, gay, lesbian and transsexual/transvestite) friendly guild. Note the word <em>friendly</em> as opposed to 'exclusive'. In one bold move, Blizzard has come down hard in favor of the bigot status quo of its player base.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.innewsweekly.com/innews/?class_code=Ga&article_code=1172">In Newsweekly has the detail:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Sara Andrews thought it was a big misunderstanding when she received an e-mail from a game master in Blizzard Entertainment's popular online role playing game "World of Warcraft" citing her for "Harassment - Sexual Orientation."</p>
<p>Andrews had posted that she was recruiting for a "GLBT friendly" guild in a general chat channel within the game.</p>
<p>Believing that her notice had been accidentally flagged, she e-mailed Blizzard to correct the problem. Blizzard, to Andrews' surprise, upheld the decision.</p>
<p>Other gay guilds have been alerted and are planning to request clarification on the policy from Blizzard.</p>
<p>Blizzard's policy on "Harassment - Sexual Orientation," which is set forth in the games' "Terms of Use" and cited in the e-mail to Andrews reads, "This category includes both clear and masked language which insultingly refers to any aspect of sexual orientation pertaining to themselves or other players."</p>
</blockquote>

In protest of Blizzard's bigot-friendly guild policy, The Consumerist has started a GBLT-friendly of our own: "And The Holograms". Above, Amphisbaena and The Holograms poses with his alluring boyfriend, Nyarlathotep and the Holograms. Note that we are not only gay, bisexual, lesbian and transvestite friendly, but also zombie and (by association) necrophiliac friendly. Also notice that our official tabards are as gay-friendly as they get: pink with a fluorescent blue heart. Our guild, of course, is named after the hit 80's cartoon show, <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3428771856883769976&q=jem+and+the+holograms">Jem and the Holograms</a>, which was truly outrageous. </p>
<p>Are you a lesbian friendly (and, really... who ISN'T?) Consumerist reader on Europe's Shadow Moon server, playing as Horde? Are you a passionate opponent of make-belief elf bigotry? Why not join in protest today!</p>
