excerpt: Earlier, we here at the Consumerist were brave enough to tell you about a
  recent London subway PSP advertisement that gleefully encouraged Sony customers
  to kill themselves. We took the opportunity in reporting this to wonder whether
  or not Sony's next subversive advertisement tact might be to encourage their customers
  to start killing people.
