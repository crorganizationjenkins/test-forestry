<p>Want to sneak in a few extra dollars from your Amazon orders? This nice man name of Jim has a tip for you regarding <a href="http://www.bargaineering.com/articles/amazons-price-drop-policy.html">Amazon's price drop policy</a>. It's pretty simple, really.</p>
<p>It seems that Amazon will guarantee their price for up to thirty days, even if the item was on sale or had a 'Buy Both and Save' deal. Just take a look through your last month's orders, see if the prices are any lower, and send Amazon a quick email for a reimbursement.</p>
<p>It's a good tip, although only moderately useful right now. A quick perusal of our last month of Amazon orders shows that most of the prices have gone <i>up</i>, not down, after Christmas.</p>
