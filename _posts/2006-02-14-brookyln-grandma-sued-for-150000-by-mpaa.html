<p>63-year old Janice McBride is getting sued by Hollywood for pirating the Adam Sandler flick, <em>The Longest Yard</em>.</p>
<p>
Why are they going after an old lady living in the ghetto?<br />
 she asked New York Daily News reporters, who seemed unwilling or unable to answer her question.</p>
<p>Janice is clueless as to how the film passed through her computer. As it stands, she<br />
s not accused of downloading but for sharing it via peer to peer. Her 16 year old grandson who lives with her and shares the computer was not available for comment.</p>
<p>It<br />
s unfortunate that Janice<br />
s life should be ruined over such a crappy movie. We'll go down like Bonnie & Clyde to stay free, clutching our <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059170/">Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!</a></em> bootleg.</p>
