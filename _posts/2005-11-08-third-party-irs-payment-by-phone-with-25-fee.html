excerpt: Would you like to pay your taxes with a credit or debit card via the phone?
  If so, be prepared to spend an additional 2.5% of your total payment amount to use
  one of the approved third-party payment services. Both the disengenuously named
  Official Payments and Pay1040 charge a two-and-a-half percent service fee (okay,
  2.49% for Pay1040) for performing the simple task of taking your money and passing
  it on to the IRS.

<p>Would you like to pay your taxes with a credit or debit card via the phone? If so, be prepared to spend an additional 2.5% of your total payment amount to use one of the approved third-party payment services.

<p>It might be the ultimate in sweetheart deals: getting people to pay unnecessarily high service charges <i>on taxes</i>. Why can't the IRS do this themselves and pay for it out of&mdash;oh gosh, I really don't know&mdash;our taxes?</p>
<p>The Consumerist was first alerted to these services via an official, taxpayer-funded mailing from the IRS.</p>
