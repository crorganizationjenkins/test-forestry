<p>"Although you can no longer donate blood, the American Red Cross will continue to provide for the blood needs of you and our loved ones."</p>
<p>You'd think that "but it's probably a false positive" would be listed more explicitly on <a href="http://montecorethetiger.com/2003/11/20/the-red-cross-gave-me-hivaids">your Red Cross blood report informing you you're HIV-positive</a>.</p>
<p>It's a customer service issue. "Although we've unnecessarily caused you to totally flip out and think your girlfriend is giving it away like leftover high school cupcakes, feel free to refer your friends and family to our fine services," seems a bit mercenary...</p>
