excerpt: I don't think it's necessary at any level. It's really no different then
  yelling "fat fuck" at a fat person on a treadmill.That, friends, is how you talk
  to customers. (Before you .zip up their account and cancel them, like Hoffman did
  to the customer who was complaining.)

<p>It only takes one "dick" to tear us all apart. Case in point: This drama-packed thread detailing one customer's horrid experiences with web hosting company <a href="http://textdrive.com">TextDrive</a>. Here's the dick in question, posted by TextDrive President and COO Jason Hoffman, in a thread where a person was complaining about server uptime:<br />
<blockquote>There's really just one rule at textdrive, and that's at every level, and that is Don't be an asshole. Some rephrase it as Don't be a dick. It's not really about awe, or being uptight, or being chill, it's simply about being a dick.<br />

<p>If you'd like to waste entirely too much time reading the whole saga like we did, start <a href="http://www.kickflop.net/blog/?cat=10">at the bottom of this category page</a> and move up. The original complain in the TextDrive forum was locked, but you can download a copy from Kickflop.net.</p>
