<p>Fantastic pack of commercials for "The World of Comedy International Film Festival." Perfectly satirizes film festival preening, wherein artsy reporters intensely interview the makers of an a slapstick comedy as if they were auteurs. </p>
<p>We wish all other commercials were as good as these. Then we would watch ads more closely and perhaps buy more products. Please make better ads, thank you. </p>
