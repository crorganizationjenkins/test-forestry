<p>As if fast-food weren't synthetic enough already, here's an automated Taco-Bell ordering machine snapped in Morisville, NC. </p>
<p>"You go to the machines and you're presented by an animated Colonel and talking taco," writes the photographer, <a href="http://abir.shundor.com/">Abir Majumdar</a>.</p>
<p>Will completely robotified Fast Food restaurants become the norm? Doubtful. Just like the supermarket there will be a mix of touch-screen and real cashiers. You also always will need an employee around in case someone can't figue out how to work the machines or the machines mess up. </p>
<p>So, no completely android fast-food eateries.</p>
<p>At least, for this generation.</p>
