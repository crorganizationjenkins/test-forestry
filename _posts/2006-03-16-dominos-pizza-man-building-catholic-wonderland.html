<p>Did you know the founder of Domino's Pizza is building a Catholic utopia? </p>
<p>From <em>Slate</em>:</p>
<ul>"In March of last year, Tom Monaghan, founder of Domino's Pizza, <a href="http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/04761831.asp">promised</a> that Ave Maria, the planned community he is developing near Naples, Fla., would be a Roman Catholic haven in secular America. "We're going to control all the commercial real estate, so there's not going to be any pornography sold in this town," he said. "We're controlling the cable system. The pharmacies are not going to be able to sell condoms or dispense contraceptives."</ul>
<p>And now <strong>you</strong> know. And knowing is not only power, it's also half the battle.</p>
<p>Makes one reconsider their whole 555 propostion, wherein you get three pizzas for five bucks apiece. The holy trinity, father, son, holy ghost. There's some definite numerological signifigances to be investigated here, for sure.</p>
<p>Not that we have a problem with people creating a gated, catholic lifestyler comunity. Just that you might think a little extra hard with biting into that slice of pepperoni deep dish. That's the sweat of God dripping down your chin.</p>
<p>Daddy, do they serve pizza in heaven?</p>
