excerpt: try to leave the store. They try to FORCE everyone to stop and have their
  receipts & carts checked before they leave the store. I cannot tell you how much
  this bothers me. Once I pay for my merchandise, it is MINE - I own it! If they want
  to check my cart or my receipt, they need probably cause to detain me - otherwise
  it is illegal search & seizure. They want me to wait in one line for 30 minutes
  to check out, and then wait another 5 minutes to have some lackey check my receipt?
  FORGET IT! I have complained about this repeatedly to the store manager. They claim
  it is to make sure that I haven't been "over-charged" for anything. But after some
  argument, they admit it is used to keep tabs on their employees, and make sure that
  the checkers are actually scanning all items. Is that my problem? Nope! And I refuse
  to be have my civil rights violated because they don't trust their employees.This
  sounds like a job for an attorney or someone who has had at least one cup of coffee,
  but Kaje raises an interesting point. How can stores legally search your bags or
  cart after you've paid for an item? Doesn't the ownership of the goods transfer
  once you have been given the receipt or bill of sale? Wouldn't refusing a search
  on their property lead to, at worse, an ejection from the premises? (You know, like,
  ejected all the way out to your car so you can drive home?)

<p>Reader 'Kaje' sent in an email with a couple of valid complaints about Costco, so rather than cram them all into a blockquote and see what happens, we thought we'd pull out the salient bits to get your responses about one issue at a time. In this instance, although Kaje is talking about Costco, it's could really apply to just about any big box store.<br />
<blockquote>And speaking of illegal, I haven't even mentioned their acts of false arrest every time I<br />
