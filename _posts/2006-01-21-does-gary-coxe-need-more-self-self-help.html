<p>Haven't had enough of <a href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/spam/spam-white-dude-had-it-rough-wants-to-show-you-his-helicopter-148230.php">Gary Coxe, self-help superstar</a>? This anonymous tipster writes to tell us exactly how successful Gary's amazing program has been for Coxe himself:<br />
<blockquote>The helicopter Gary is standing behind is not even his. He leases it!</p></blockquote>
<p>The several business he owns are 2- a helicopter school (with a leased helicopter) where he maybe has 2 students and his company where he spams people to buy his book and where he sells self-help bullshit.</p>
<p>The building he runs BOTH business out of is a falling apart 'renovated' warehouse space.</p>
<p>He does own his own plane, but that is nothing to write home about either. It is an aztec, that looks like it should be in a scrap yard. </p>
<p>Did I mention his car. This man who supposedly has so much drives a rusted out Dodge Intrepid and his wife drives an older hyundai station wagon.</p>
<p>Oh and the ironic part is that is is always this pushy. He is also a Jehova's Witness whom will knock on your door and not shut up when you answer.</p>
<p>I have a friend who used to be a sales person for Gary and my friend will not come foward because I guess he was under some kind of contract not to 'slander' the dick, but I am a different story! Tell your friend to buck up!</p>
