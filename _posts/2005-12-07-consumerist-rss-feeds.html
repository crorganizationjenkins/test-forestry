excerpt: A few of you have asked if we have RSS feeds. We do, both in flavorful, ad-supported,
  full content and ad-free, partial content varieties. If you'd like to join Gawker
  Media in welcoming the mid-'90s hottest trend in reader response, you may also subscribe
  our our comments only feed.

<p>A few of you have asked if we have RSS feeds. We do, both in flavorful, <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/index.xml">ad-supported, full content</a> and <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/excerpts.xml">ad-free, partial content</a> varieties. If you'd like to join Gawker Media in welcoming the mid-'90s hottest trend in reader response, you may also subscribe our our <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/comments.xml">comments only feed</a>.</p>
<p>They are also linked at the bottom of the page in our Credits section, where&mdash;if we were the myspace band page we appear to be&mdash;we would include our dark, but poetic (but dark!) fan fiction.</p>
