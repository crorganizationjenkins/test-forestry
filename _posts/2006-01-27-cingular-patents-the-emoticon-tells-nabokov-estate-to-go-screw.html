excerpt: 'Cingular has patented the emoticon. From Consumer Affairs:'

<p>Cingular has patented the emoticon. <a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/01/emoticons.html">From Consumer Affairs:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Cingular Wireless has won a patent on the concept of using "emoticons" on mobile phones. The patent applies not only to graphic versions of the ubiquitous smiley/mad face but also to simple text versions. :)</p>
<p>Cingular says the aim of the patent is to enable the displaying of graphics on its subscribers' handsets, the patent would also prohibit sending simple text versions via a dedicated or programmable key.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making this patent even more obnoxious, it's a flagrant corporate flip-off to the <em>real</em> inventor of the emoticon: famous American writer and synaesthete Vladimir Nabokov, the author of Lolita, Pale Fire, Pnin and a lot of other truly astonishing works that feature not a single smiley. From his own 1973 patent application for the Nabokovmoticon, published in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679726098/qid=1108159582/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-3415411-2516801?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Strong Opinions</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile<br />
 some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket, which I would now like to trace in reply to your question.</p></blockquote>

The patent number published by Consumer Affairs doesn't come up with anything on the US Patent Office homepage search.</p>
<p><i>Update: Looks like the actual patent application is <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=cingular&OS=cingular&RS=cingular">this one</a>, which attempts to lock down the use of a "dedicated key or shared dedicated key" for adding emoticons. You know, like the shared dedicated keys 'colon' and 'closed parenthesis.'</i></p>
