  Fleshbot. Of course, the difference is that Fleshbot is hugely popular and we''re

<p>In all the Gawker Empire, only one website is as forgotten as we: <a href="http://fleshbot.com">lovely Fleshbot</a>. Of course, the difference is that Fleshbot is hugely popular and we're not, but we support our comrades all the same. We pink websites have to stick together.</p>
<p>Now if you haven't ever been to Fleshbot before, it's sort of about, you know, <i>flesh</i>. Specifically, putting flesh into other flesh, or watching those that do. If you're ready to embark on a marginally unsafe-for-work trip, Fleshbot's Violet Blue has compiled the "<a href="http://www.fleshbot.com/sex/shopping/holiday-gift-guide-group-grope-142947.php">Holiday Gift Guide Group Grope</a>," sure to make buying special DVD or toy for the family that much more easy.</p>
