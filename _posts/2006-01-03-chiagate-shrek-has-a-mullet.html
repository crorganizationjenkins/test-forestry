excerpt: It's suppose to fully grow in about a week.  It's been over a week.  Our
  Chia Shrek has a mullet.  Where did I go wrong?  Do these things suck, or is it
  me?We think that the mystery of which hairstyle will grow on your terra cotta head
  is part of the magic of Chia, but we will not rest until we discover if Chia is
  using the lovable cartoon ogre as a carrier for the reintroduction of 'parties in
  the back.'
