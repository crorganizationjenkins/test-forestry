excerpt: â€¢ We have been informed that Express's Annual $20 off all jeans sale begins
  today, and according to their website, that is totally true. However, we have also
  been informed that this sale "historically never includes the ones embellished with
  $100's worth of rhinstones on the ass."

<p>&bull; We have been informed that <a href="http://www.expressfashion.com/index.jsp">Express's Annual $20 off all jeans sale</a> begins today, and according to their website, that is totally true. However, we have also been informed that this sale "historically never includes the ones embellished with $100's worth of rhinstones on the ass."</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://www.woot.com/">Woot</a>: The Salton Breadman Ultimate Dream Machine Breadmaker for $75, shipped. We think bread machines are cute but pointless trivialities that should be replaced by a decent pan and the extra fifteen minutes it takes to knead dough by hand. But you get right on that.</p>
<p>&bull; Overstock.com has <a href="http://www.overstock.com/cgi-bin/d2.cgi?siteID=NKa3hZyYoHA-S.0cWJTExNE6o8ieqDWvWA&cid=87419">refurbished 60GB iPod photo</a> models for $350, with a 10% off coupon for new customers. $10 shipping. These aren't the new ones that will do video, but they do have color screens. [via <a href="http://dealnews.com">Dealnews</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Random craporium Hammacher Schlemmer has a <a href="http://www.hammacher.com/private_sale/ps_private_sale_1.asp?source=PRV0905&sourceid=0039869722&AFID=BEFREE01&cm_ven=BFAST&cm_pla=39869722&cm_ven=WC&cm_cat=20050928_PRVOLS&cm_pla=BYR&cm_ite=hero">private online sale with up to 70% off</a> prices. An extra 10% off code: BHE798 may work, as well. Most of their product lineup is very Skymall, but 'tis the season to be giving two-sided outdoor clocks and such.

<p>&bull; Dell's <a href="http://www.dell.com/html/ca/en/segments/dhs/flash/days_of_deals/q4wk7-05/dell_main.html">12 Days of Deals</a> has a 802.11g Wi-Fi router for $40. We have not used Dell's networking gear in many years, because it used to be crap. <i>Caveat router</i>.</p>
