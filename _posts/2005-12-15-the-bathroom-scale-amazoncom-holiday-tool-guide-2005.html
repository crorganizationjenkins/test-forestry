<p><b>The Catalog</b>: <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon.com's</a> Holiday Tool Guide 2005. Yes, the online retail giant has a <i>paper</i> catalog.</p>
<p><b>The Target</b>: People who have bought tools online from Amazon before, or the <i>current resident</i>.</p>
<p><b>The Models</b>: Although there are exceptions that may also prove out our subconcious homosexuality, like the tight pair of jeans wielding the Black & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Broom, this catalog is heavy with musky, khaki-wearing white men. There is a black family on page 22, making up two of the four pictures in the Rubbermaid section. We could not tie that into a <i>Jeffersons</i> joke, which is probably for the best.</p>
<p><b>Bathroom Reading Rating:</b> The Multi Tools page shows a strength that is missing from the rest of the catalog, diddling our fundamental male urge to purchase swords by the dozen. Other sections are bland, with product images shot in a white box with little context to show their use. The text overweighs the images. It's a lot like Amazon.com, actually.</p>
<p>Its blas&eacute; design compounds its fundamental shortcoming: reading this in the bathroom makes it nearly impossible to actually <i>order</i> anything. In fact, seeing this catalog did little more than reminds us that, "Oh yeah, Amazon sells tools." Do we really need a whole catalog when just a flyer would suffice?</p>
<p>As it says right on the busy, uninspired front cover: "See website for details."</p>
<p><i>One Dremel Cordless Pet Nail Grooming Kits out of five. As fun as printing email.</i></p>
