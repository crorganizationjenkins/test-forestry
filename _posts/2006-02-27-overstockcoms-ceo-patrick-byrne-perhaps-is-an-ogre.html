<p>We know Overstock.com sometimes has crappy customer service, as we <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/chat/overstockcom-actually-understocked-manned-by-soulless-robots-155033.php">amusingly revealed</a>.</p>
<p>But did you know that their CEO maybe engages in a systematic campaign of intimidation targeting dissenting journalists?</p>
<p>What might be inside Mr. Byrne's trunk <strong>besides the dead bodies and heroin</strong>, after the jump.</p>
<p>(We<br />
re going to put everything in<br />
perhaps<br />
 terms to avoid getting sued for libel and slander, as CEO Mr. Patrick Byrne is maybe wont to do.)</p>
<p>In a universe not entirely dissimilar to ours, the company<br />
s stock nose-dived from the 70<br />
s in 2004 to the 20<br />
s now, mainly because they probably suck.</p>
<p>During an hour-long conference call last summer, Byrne maybe kinda<br />
laid out a vast, overarching conspiracy, made up of dozens of Wall Street players... all under the thumb of a mysterious puppet master, whom Mr. Byrne labeled the Sith Lord,<br />
 <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://select.nytimes.com/2006/02/25/business/25nocera.html&OQ=_rQ3D1&OP=313fb856Q2FQ5BQ23T4Q5BQ3AgDXXQ3AQ5BOhhRQ5BhOQ5BO1Q5B4CgQ5EPTggQ5BO1PXITD@0Q2AQ3An5">according</a> to the NYT this Saturday.</p>
<p>The same article might have, meh, spoken about Mr. Byrne<br />
s suit against MarketWatch columnist Herb Greenberg and Carol Remond of Dow Jones Newswires, both of whom, in all likelihood, have been openly critical of Overstock<br />
s CEO.</p>
<p>Today, the SEC decided to halt a subpoena process involving the two reporters. </p>
<p>At least that's what word on the street is.</p>
<p>
The SEC is investigating allegations by Overstock that a research firm, Gradient Analytics, issued negative reports on the retailer in exchange for payments from a hedge fund seeking to profit from a drop in its stock price. Overstock has sued Gradient and the hedge fund in question, Rocker Partners; they deny any wrongdoing,<br />
 we kinda think the Associated Press <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-SEC-Columnists.html">reported</a> today.</p>
<p>If our hunch is correct, the CEO in one breath referenced Mark Cuban, who proudly has shorted 20,000 shares of Overstock.com and would short more if he possibly could, and his<br />
friends<br />
, and in the next breath, talks about gangsters. (Any correlations drawn between the two can be explained by a phenomenon known as Gestaltian Psychic Dissonance. We think.)</p>
<p>Patrick Byrne said, at least that's if you believe what seems to be written on <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000233073446/">Mark Cuban's blog</a>,<br />
Some of the people I<br />
m up against are mobsters. I fully expect you<br />
re going to hear about the police stopping me with a pound of heroin, or a dead body, or something in my trunk.</p>
<p>How about a bunch of crappy earnings reports and the souls of the customers you suckered in your trunk? How about that creepy it<br />
s all about the O Lady in your trunk? How about the American Dream in your trunk? Huh? HUH!??!?!?</p>
<p>We're just asking.</p>
<p>Tell us, what might be in Mr. Patrick Byrne<br />
s trunk?</p>
