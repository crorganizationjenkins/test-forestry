excerpt: 'There''s an excellent entry up over at Scatterbox detailing Sony''s perfidious
  scum-suckery (ed - penultimate ''s'' chipperly added because The Consumerist is,
  at heart, a family publication). First: the spyware and malware they surreptitiously
  installed on the computers of thousands of people who had actually bothered to buy
  their CDs; then, vandalizing other people''s property so they could tattoo their
  rainbow corporate swastika in public places on somebody else''s dime. These guys
  are sleazy enough that a mere push would send them in a frictionless glide right
  across the pit full of jagged glass bottles and honey consumers would like to roll
  them in.'

<p>Steven Silvers has got an excellent message to send to Sony and other businesses engaging in "stealth marketing":</p>
<blockquote><p>As the <em>hide-your-marketing</em> hype reaches its inevitable peak, Sony<br />
s very public image problems are bound to be followed in 2006 by other companies that ignore this reality of the information age:</p>
<p><strong>Your stealth marketing will be only as successful as the reaction consumers have when they realize who<br />
s behind it and what you<br />
ve been up to.</strong></p>
<p>And, yes, they will find out. </p>
</blockquote>

Read the whole thing. For a refreshing change of pace, there's a great Orwell quote in there that <em>isn't</em> being used by both political hemispheres to either defend or offend President Bush, depending on the quoter.</p>
