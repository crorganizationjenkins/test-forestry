<p>Where's the cheapest place to get Willow Boughs and Fruit, these two classic wallpapers designed by master industrial revolutionist William Morris?</p>
<p>You can meander through dappled, interlacing boughs of the NYT<br />
s<br />
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/business/yourmoney/26thrifty.html">Thrifty Millionaire</a><br />
 column or cut to the quick: call Peter Jones, a large London department store at +44+020/7730-3434</p>
<p>To wallpaper an average room with high ceilings takes about ten rolls. With shipping this should cost you $685, about<br />
 of what an American importer like <a href="http://www.janovic.com/">Janovic/Plaza</a> charges.</p>
<p>Both pattern's intricate designs are useful, too, if you have a predilection for accidentally encasing wives, cats or other shrill felines in your remodelling efforts.</p>
