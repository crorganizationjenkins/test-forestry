excerpt: There's a truly horrifying gaggle of monstrous corporate mascots and images
  over at Plan 59. 1950's advertising was just plain creepy isn't new to anyone, but
  this girl eagerly awaiting for a disembodied hand to finish spreading brains on
  a slice of cellophane bread, looks as if she can unhinge your jaw and swallow your
  soul. This proposed barbecue stand resembles an illustration from Ralph Steadman's
  Animal Farm. This dish only looks edible if you are Andy Milonakis' son... until
  you consider eating someone else's barf instead. This kid is a leper while a young
  Michael Berryman eats a plate full of entrails.
