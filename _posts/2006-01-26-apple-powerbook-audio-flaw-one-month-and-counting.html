excerpt: Owners of the last generation of 'high-resolution' Apple Powerbooks are reporting
  major audio issues that cause an echo or looping effect to occur when playing sound.
  That's a real problem for a platform used heavily by musicians and video artists,
  so one would expect Apple to fix the problem as soon as possible.

<p>Owners of the last generation of 'high-resolution' Apple Powerbooks are reporting <a href="http://powerbookdefect.info/">major audio issues</a> that cause an echo or looping effect to occur when playing sound. That's a real problem for a platform used heavily by musicians and video artists, so one would expect Apple to fix the problem as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Well, Apple <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=302978">acknowledged the problem</a> on December 16th, but no fix has been issued, save Apple's suggestion to "run only one audio application at a time." Since many report that external sound hardware alleviates the issue, it could be that the problem is hardware-based, making a quick patch impossible.</p>
<p>So much for that old chestnut to "only ever buy Apple hardware past the first generation."</p>
