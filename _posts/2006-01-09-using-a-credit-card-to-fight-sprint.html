excerpt: We have an unfortunate/fortunate lack of credit cards, so we are not able
  to take advantage of the protection services afford customers from credit card providers.
  Ramit "I Will Teach You to Be Rich" Sethi had been struggling with Sprint for quite
  some time, and despite reaching a supposed resolution, he was still charged a fee
  for his early cancellationâ€”despite the fact he did not have a contract.

<p>We have an unfortunate/fortunate lack of credit cards, so we are not able to take advantage of the protection services afford customers from credit card providers. Ramit "I Will Teach You to Be Rich" Sethi had been struggling with Sprint for quite some time, and despite reaching a supposed resolution, he was <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/archives/2006/01/how_to_dispute.html">still charged a fee</a> for his early cancellation&mdash;despite the fact he did not have a contract.</p>
<p>So what'd he do to fix it?<br />
<blockquote>I called my credit card and told them I wanted to dispute a charge. They said, "Sure, what's your address and what's the amount?" When I told them, they instantly gave me a temporary credit for the amount, and told me to mail in a form with my complaint.<br />
I did so, including my notes and everything. 2 weeks later, the complaint was totally resolved--in my favor. In other words, that temporary credit became permanent, and I didn't have to pay. Sprint had to eat the cost. And rightfully so, those jackasses.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there you have it. One can use a credit card to charge back disputed fees, and yet another person has inscribed into Google that Sprint is staffed with jackasses.</p>
<p>What other consumer protections from credit cards have you taken advantage of?</p>
