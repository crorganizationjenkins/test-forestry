<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/icedevil.jpg"></a>In a severely cute marriage of form and illegal function, British police convicted William Agnew for running a video game piracy ring from his ice cream truck. Bobbies seized over 4,000 counterfeited video games, cd<br />
s and DVD<br />
s valued at<br />
100,000 or $174,345.29 in unilateral decision making money.</p>
