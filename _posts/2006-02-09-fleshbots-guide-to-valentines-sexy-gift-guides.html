<p>Our sexy sister site Fleshbot&mdash;yes, she's easy; no, we don't mind&mdash;has put together their <a href="http://www.fleshbot.com/sex/shopping/horny-valentines-gift-guide-guide-153026.php">'Horny Valentine's Gift Guide Guide.'</a> In case you need help dissecting the title, please let us assist you before you click the link.</p>
<p>'Horny' means there are pictures of dildos and breasts, so if you work in a more staid environment, please wait until you've headed home before you start shopping.</p>
<p>'Guide Guide' means it's a guide <i>to</i> guides, serving as a index to others' ideas.</p>
<p>'Gift' means you should probably buy your sweetheart the 'Clone a Willy,' which allows one to mold a life-sized recreation of a penis in chocolate. Our suggestion? Offer your loved one a clone of your best friend's penis and see if they recognize it. Be both romantic <i>and</i> resourceful!</p>
