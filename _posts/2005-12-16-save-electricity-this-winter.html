excerpt: The reason I ask is that my roommates think it takes more electricity to
  turn the AC off and then turn it back on later.The answer? Turning it off at night
  is fine, because "it definitely takes more energy to remove that heat constantly
  rather than removing it just once when you turn the AC back on later."

<p>We started to read 'Mr. Electricity's' page because we wanted to know about the most efficient way to keep ourselves from freezing this winter, but we sort of got distracted by some of his other information. Mostly because we use gas heat and somewhat because we've always wanted to know the answer to <a href="http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/cooling.html">this question</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Which uses less electricity:<br />
	1.	Keeping the AC on constantly.<br />
	2.	Having the AC on during the day, then turning it off and opening the windows instead in the evening when it's cool, then turning the AC back on when we go to bed.<br />

<p>This guy knows how to save money using electricity! We think we're going to turn up the gas heater real toasty and read this for a while. (<i>Thanks, Spring!</i>)</p>
