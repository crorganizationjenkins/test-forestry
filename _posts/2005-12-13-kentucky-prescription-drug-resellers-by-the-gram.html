excerpt: '"They justify it because they''re having a hard time financially," he said.
  "Left to ourselves, we can justify anything, but they''re really part of the problem."Of
  course the real question is: Are these Grandmothers of Slangin'' maximizing their
  profits by buying from discount overseas pharmacies? And if so, which ones, and
  can we get their domain names?'

<p>Drug-selling grannies! Finally, a story we can sink our gums into. It seems that one industry is finally giving <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/news/13337741.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp">moonshining</a> a run for its money in Kentucky: reselling prescription drugs to addicts (or, you know, people who like to take painkillers). Since April of '04, over <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/12/12/elderly.dealers.ap/index.html">40 senior citizens have been charged with selling drugs</a>, putting a strain on a incarceration system ill-equipped to handle the elderly.<br />
<blockquote>The Rev. Doug Abner, pastor of Community Church in Manchester and an anti-drug activist, said senior citizens may not understand the seriousness of selling prescription drugs.<br />
"They justify it because they're having a hard time financially," he said. "Left to ourselves, we can justify anything, but they're really part of the problem."</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course the real question is: Are these Grandmothers of Slangin' maximizing their profits by buying from discount overseas pharmacies? And if so, which ones, and can we get their domain names?</p>
<p>We have this headache. And no insurance.</p>
