<p>&bull; Get your name on a microchip that isn't inside a robot from the future, thanks to <a href="http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/DawnCommunity/Sendname2asteroid/index_asteroid_blt.aspx">NASA's Dawn space craft</a>. Soon your name will reside with thousands of others on a dead rock in the cold reaches of space.</p>
<p>&bull; Have a sample of Johnson's Sooth Naturals Skin care cream. From a <a href="http://www.johnsonsbaby.com/soothingnaturals/">company</a>, not us. We won't give you a baby, either, but if you ask nicely, we will take your unwanted children away to be made into more lotion.</p>
<p>&bull; Ask yourself if today is the day to lose again at <a href="http://dell.eprize.net/regifting/">The Dell Game</a>. Of course, you know that it is, but you click anyway, programmed.</p>
<p>&bull; Okay, this isn't really a freebie, but we'll toss it in: <a href="http://lowendmac.com/menagh/05/1215.html">What it takes to get a 'Free' Mac Mini (or iPod, or PSP, or Whatever); One Man's Journey</a></p>
