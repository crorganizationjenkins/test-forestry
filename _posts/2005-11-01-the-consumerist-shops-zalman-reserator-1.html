excerpt: This water cooling tower was purchased to keep our loud, home-built PC from
  echoing off concrete walls. To that end, the Zalman Reserator 1 worked well. Unfortunately,
  it soon (two-three weeks) acquired a buzz all its own, likely due to a faulty impeller
  blade in the aquarium pump that circulates water through the entire system.

<p>This water cooling tower was purchased to keep our loud, home-built PC from echoing off concrete walls. To that end, the Zalman Reserator 1 worked well. Unfortunately, it soon (two-three weeks) acquired a buzz all its own, likely due to a faulty impeller blade in the aquarium pump that circulates water through the entire system.</p>
<p>In early October, the pump stopped functioning altogether. Zalman's customer service department, contacted by phone, offered to send a replacement, if we were willing to ship the faulty pump back. We agreed to these terms and received notice that our replacement pump would arrive in 3-5 business days. Two full weeks later, we have not received the pump.</p>
<p>Verdict: Water cooling is nifty and quiet, but when it breaks, the high heat and difficult replacement procedure jeopardizes the entire computer.</p>
