excerpt: We realize this isn't a New York-only site (thank god for that, actually),
  but this whole transit strike has got us all a bit mixed up. This one goes out to
  my commuting homies.

<p>We realize this isn't a New York-only site (thank god for that, actually), but this whole transit strike has got us all a bit mixed up. This one goes out to my commuting homies.</p>
<p>A natural reaction to the strike is to say, "Those cabbies are going to make out like <i>whoa</i>." It would seem that isn't actually the case, with pricing locked down at lower, capped rates. There's a $10 maximum, for example, for travel within one fare zone, and a flat-rate $30 charge to <i>and</i> from LaGuardia.</p>
<p>Sounds awesome, until you realize there will likely also be four other people crammed into the cab with you&mdash;and that's assuming you'll find one to hail at all. Suddenly those Segways don't sound so stupid.</p>
