<li>eBay is offering listings today only for $.10. Remember, most sex toys are machine-washable. [<a href="http://slickdeals.net/#p6681">via Slickdeals</a>]
</li>
<li>Daily surprise overstocker Woot is selling their own Tuscan-style red wine, the <a href="http://www.woot.com/">Rinfrescante</a>. In half-cases of six, it's $11 a bottle, far beyond the price of modern four-dollars?-fuck-it table wines. The spirit is right on&mdash;now work on the price.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site//olspage.jsp?id=cat03001&type=category">Best Buy</a> continues its sale on televisions, offering discounts and free shipping for nearly all online orders. The deals are legit, for the most part, but also signify Best Buy's desire to clear out old stock before Christmas. (Whether for new, improved models of TVs or just more room in general, The Consumerist knows not.)</li>
</ul>
