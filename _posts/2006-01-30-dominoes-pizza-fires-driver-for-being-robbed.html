excerpt: Everyone has seen the signs saying, 'The delivery does not have more than
  $20 in cash.' Who knew that having more than $20 on hand was a fireable offense?
  According to The Roanoke Times, Christine Clayborne, a six-year veteran of pizza
  delivery with Dominoes, was fired after she was robbed on the job, because having
  more than $20 made her "look like a target," she says. At least she's kept a good
  sense of humor about the robbery:Before she could respond, a man wearing a ski mask
  and crouched close to the ground sprayed her with a fire extinguisher.

<p>Everyone has seen the signs saying, 'The delivery does not have more than $20 in cash.' Who knew that having more than $20 on hand was a fireable offense? According to The Roanoke <i>Times</i>, Christine Clayborne, a six-year veteran of pizza delivery with Dominoes, was <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/48952">fired after she was robbed on the job</a>, because having more than $20 made her "look like a target," she says. At least she's kept a good sense of humor about the robbery:<br />
<blockquote>Before she could respond, a man wearing a ski mask and crouched close to the ground sprayed her with a fire extinguisher.</p></blockquote>
<p>"I was in disbelief," Clayborne said.</p>
<p>She couldn't see. Her whole body was covered in white foam.</p>
<p>"Is this guy serious?" Clayborne said she asked herself at the time. "It was the funniest thing. He seemed pretty shaky."Clayborne's bosses say she is liable for any money lost over $20, which seems nearly impossible for a driver to manage if they have multiple stops on a delivery, but far more reasonable than any justification that could be used to fire an employee of six years just because she had some bad luck. She deserves an apology&mdash;and her job back. (<i>Thanks, Davis!</i>)</p>
