excerpt: This question is our own and we've yet to find a suitable answer, despite
  doing a fair amount of research into it. Is there a way to sort search results on
  Amazon to reflect 'Amazon-only' orders? Which is to say, orders that are sold and
  shipped directly from Amazon?

<p>This question is our own and we've yet to find a suitable answer, despite doing a fair amount of research into it. Is there a way to sort search results on Amazon to reflect 'Amazon-only' orders? Which is to say, orders that are sold and shipped directly from Amazon?</p>
<p>We are Amazon Prime users, so we always want to be able to claim our free two-day shipping, which only applies to orders from Amazon directly&mdash;not third-party vendors.</p>
<p>It could be that Amazon doesn't want to make the method available because it might perturb their sellers, but that hardly seems like our problem. Any ideas?</p>
<p>(While we're at it, we wouldn't mind being able to sort by 'in stock,' as well.)</p>
<p><i>Update: Reader Aviva notes that "Apparel & Accessories already has a link "Shop Direct from Amazon.com." Bastards! That's what we want, but </i>everywhere.</p>
