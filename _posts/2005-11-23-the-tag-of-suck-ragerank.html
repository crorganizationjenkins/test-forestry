excerpt: David Galbraith, founder of Wists, crony of known Hungarians, and guy who
  can never complete a phone call, hates T-Mobile. That's not the story. Out of any
  random sample of American cell phone users, at least half would hate T-Mobile. Mostly
  out of an irrational fear that subscribing to a service hawked by Catherine Zeta
  Jones could somehow cause pictures of Michael Douglas's bare ass to be beamed through
  space into their phone, but still.

<p>David Galbraith, founder of <a href="http://wists.com">Wists</a>, crony of known Hungarians, and guy who can never complete a phone call, hates T-Mobile. That's not the story. Out of any random sample of American cell phone users, at least half would hate T-Mobile. Mostly out of an irrational fear that subscribing to a service hawked by Catherine Zeta Jones could somehow cause pictures of Michael Douglas's bare ass to be beamed through space into their phone, but still.</p>
<p>Rather than just complain that T-Mo sucks, David's taken <i>action</i> as only a blog post can do. He's proposing that folks use the tag 'ragerank' to pollute the brand when it bubbles up in Google searches.</p>
<p>Will it work? Maybe. Probably not. We need a little more pep in our tags, ourselves, and there's just not enough venom in 'ragerank' when dealing with a company powered by the blood of innocents.</p>
<p>But tags are cheap and we are dumb, so anything is possible.</p>
