<p>The cover promises cheapness, with "142 Great Gifts Starting at $5," and "Best Bargain Hotels," although our first inkling that something might be amiss is hidden in the corner: "Is It Time to Buy a Flat-Screen TV?" We don't know, is it? We thought we were on a budget.</p>
<p>The gift guide looks wholly unaltered from any random woman's-interest gift guide this Christmas. And come on&mdash;a $40 iPod case? That's not a bargain. A $190 professional steamer? You know what's cheap? <i>Not steaming your clothes</i>.</p>
<p>Don't get us started on the $125 Martin Robitsch Schaschlik knife holder, which is quite literally a wooden box filled with bamboo skewers. You could literally build it yourself for about $10 in parts and perhaps 10 minutes of labor&mdash;15 if you sanded it. It's insulting that 'Budget Living' would even suggest it.</p>
<p>The hotel guide is quite a bit better, with the most expensive room running $190 a night, with an average room price of $107 and change&mdash;not bad for rooms that are a marked cut above the average Super 8 fare.</p>
<p>And pity the poor soul who uses <i>Budget Living</i>'s flat-panel TV buyers' guide, with its sidebar showing the 'hidden costs' of the purchase, including a $400 to $600 installation cost. It's only hidden because <i>you're</i> hiding it, <i>BL</i>. Tell people not to get it installed, instead.</p>
<p>Maybe it's our own fault we're disappointed. We were hoping for <i>MAKE</i>, but for shopping. Instead we got the stock-standard magalog, just minus the ridiculous high-end color products that nobody ever buys anyway.</p>
