<p>Priceline.com had concert pianist Ronnie Segev <a href="http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/61998.htm">thrown in jail on charges of harrassment</a> after the upset customer called the company 215 times in an attempt to secure a refund for a $953 airline ticket he had never purchased. From The <i>Post</i>:<br />
<blockquote>A judge later dismissed the charges, but not before Segev spent 40 hours in a Manhattan holding cell with hardened criminals who laughed at him, threatened him and tried to steal his fancy watch and sneakers.</p></blockquote>
<p>A tough-looking cellmate asked him, "So, what are you in for?"</p>
<p>"Priceline refund," the musician sheepishly replied. It went downhill from there.Segev has still not recieved a refund, but has filed a malicious prosecution suit against Priceline. (<i>Thanks, Com!</i>)</p>
