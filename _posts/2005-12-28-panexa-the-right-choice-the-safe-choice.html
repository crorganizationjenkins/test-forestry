excerpt: Gelf Magazine has an interview with Carrie McLaren of Stay Free!, a Brooklyn-based
  media outlet that "explores the politics and perversions of mass media and American
  (consumer) culture." Which is to say, hippies gnawing on at the trunk of the freedom
  tree.

<p>Gelf Magazine has <a href="http://www.gelfmagazine.com/mt/archives/pillpopping.html">an interview with Carrie McLaren</a> of <a href="http://blog.stayfreemagazine.org/">Stay Free!</a>, a Brooklyn-based media outlet that "explores the politics and perversions of mass media and American (consumer) culture." Which is to say, hippies gnawing on at the trunk of the freedom tree.</p>
<p>Using the 'remix' technique that is <a href="http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/humor/humor_ads.shtml">as old as the hills</a>, Stay Free has created the false drug <a href="http://panexa.com">Panexa</a> as an attempt to expose the absurdities of pharmaceutical advertising.</p>
<p>Does it work? It didn't stop us from buying prescription drugs from Canada this morning, but their take on the strange photography used in drug ads is spot on.</p>
