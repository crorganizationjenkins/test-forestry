s fashion show last week. As the photo series demonstrates, apparently the high fashion you should sprint out to buy next fall is junk-food themed sleeper ware, complete with over-sized donut bracelets. </p>
<p>Pizza, hotdogs, burgers, fries and ice-cream are among the gut-busters showcased in the carnival of calories. We were into the one with the girl sporting a yellow cubic pattern until we realized those were fries. Note too that the face on the fry box bares a striking resemblance to Meatwad from <em>Aqua Teen Hunger Force</em>.</p>
<p>Extravagant couture whereby a dress is transformed into a spindly, sequin encrusted clamshell? <i>That</i> we can deal with, but it<br />
s simply stupefying that we should be expected to wear a giant burger shirt complete with 3D frilly lettuce detail. Not to mention disgusting.</p>
<p>Jeremy Scott<br />
s bio states that his,<br />
collections are narcissistic without apology, theatrical beyond compare, and designed for women who love to dress up and play the part of ultimate diva.<br />
  The ultimate double-whopper with cheese and bacon diva, that is. Among the celebrities sporting the gear after too many chocolate shake brain freezes are Bjork, Cameron Diaz, Christina Aguilera, Kylie Minogue and Madonna. The others we can understand but Cameron! You<br />
re the virgin suicide from next door we wanted to take to the prom and bone on the top of Lookout Mountain! Two all-beef patties slathered in a Snickers bar is not your look, baby. Or for that matter, anyone else's.</p>
