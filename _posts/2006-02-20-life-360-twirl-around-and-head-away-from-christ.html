<p>The 360 labeling was pretty bizarre even before it was stapled to the Christian faith. In case you don't follow the cut of our gyst, stand up. Whirl around in a three hundred and sixty degree rotation. Notice that you are headed in the exact same direction you were headed before. While this directive may simply be nonsensical for a video game console, it has entirely different ramifications as a Christian message. Presumably, Christians don't want pederasts and the morally slothful to do a 360, then continue to charge debauchery first in the exact same direction they were previously headed. What they want them to be doing is a 180, right into the open arms of Christ.</p>
