excerpt: We hate Morgan Spurlock. Hate hate hate hate hate him. We swear to Buddha,
  90% of this video of Mortal Kombat 3 fatalities is what would happen to him if John
  Brownlee ever, ever got his massive, Incredible-Hulk-like hands on the greasy little
  turd. The last 10% of the video — the part featuring Mortal Kombat 3's Babalities
  — is what would happen if Ben Popken ever got the small, playdough-like lumps of
  his pudgy toddler's fists on Spurlock. Such is our rage.

<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/spurlock.jpg"></a>We hate Morgan Spurlock. Hate hate hate hate hate him. We swear to Buddha, 90% of <a href="http://www.poetv.com/video.php?vid=1519">this video of <em>Mortal Kombat 3</em> fatalities</a> is what would happen to him if John Brownlee ever, <strong>ever</strong> got his massive, Incredible-Hulk-like hands on the greasy little turd. The last 10% of the video &mdash; the part featuring <em>Mortal Kombat 3's</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babalities">Babalities</a> &mdash; is what would happen if Ben Popken ever got the small, playdough-like lumps of his pudgy toddler's fists on Spurlock. Such is our rage.</p>
<p>Why do we hate him? He's everything we advocate against &mdash; irresponsible and duplicitous consumerist complaint. His various studies, "documentaries" and critiques are nothing but junk science lazily arranged to support presupposed conclusions. If you want more detail on that, <a href="http://www.spurlockwatch.typepad.com/">flip through this blog.</a> We're sorry &mdash; we aren't going to take dietary advice from a man who first made his mark paying people on MTV to eat dog feces.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, McDonald's has had a PR nightmare on their hands ever since the release of <em>Super Size Me</em>... and now there are rumblings that a recent site that has been launched called <a href="http://www.30daydieters.com/">30 Day Dieters</a> is actually being fronted by McDonald's themselves. The site features the testimonies of people who ate sensibly at McDonald's for thirty days and lost weight, and these accounts <em>are</em> real. But we've talked before about how companies are best served in their full disclosure of their marketing attempts on the Internet and the blogosphere. Doing otherwise just makes us trust them less, less likely to listen to their points.</p>
<p>Hey, McDonald's &mdash; if you have something to say and have the proof to back it up, we'll listen. But don't try to fool us. None of us are as stupid as the corporate world seems to believe and we don't need a Golden Arches slapped on the template to see through your patronizing charade.</p>
