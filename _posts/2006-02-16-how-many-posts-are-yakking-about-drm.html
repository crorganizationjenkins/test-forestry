<p>Does the glut of DRM drama have you reaching for the dramamine? As the chart below illustrates, you're not crazy, lots and lots of people are talking about it. Here's a graph of DRM mentions over the past year by post count.</p></p>
<p>Technorati's chart graphs the number of posts from English-language blogs with high authority mentioning DRM over the past 360 days. </p>
<p>Compare this to the same selection criteria for <a href="http://www.technorati.com/chart/a?chartdays=360&language=en&authority=a7">the letter a</a>.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.technorati.com/chart/airline?chartdays=360&language=en&authority=a7">airline</a>.</p>
<p>And porn, after the jump.</p>
<p>Yup, it's a graph of mentions of porn.</p>
<p><img alt="porn.jpg" class="center-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/porn.jpg" width="421" height="292" /></p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.technorati.com/chart/rock?chartdays=360&language=en&authority=a7">rock</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe more people are just blogging about more things and DRM happens to be one of them? John Kricfalusi, Ren & Stimpy animator, just started a blog called, "<a href="http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/">All Kinds of Stuff.</a>"</p>
<p>While you check out his previously unreleased material, we have to go work on our investigative report uncovering what companies don't want you to know about hatracks.</p>
