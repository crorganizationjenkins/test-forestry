excerpt: 'Since you''ll likely be busy with family and friends this weekend, let us
  leave you with this story of Christmas from Richard Shenkman''s Legends, Lies &
  Cherished Myths of American History:Until the Civil War Christmas was but scantily
  observed. Most shockingly, retailers hardly seemed to take notice of the occasion.
  Historians report that the pages of the New York Tribune in 1841 did not contain
  a single example of advertising with a Christmas theme. It wasn''t until after the
  Civil War that retailers began experimenting with special Christmas sales. Once
  they did, however, it didn''t take long for them to discover the commercial possibilities
  offered by the holiday. By 1970 December had become the merchants'' single largest
  selling month of the year.No matter what you celebrate over the next few days, let
  us join together to worship our Christmas''s most hallowed savior: Mammon.'
