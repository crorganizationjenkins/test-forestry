<p>Anyhoo, the ministore at the bottom (which I leave on) had a message explaining that the ministore option sent small amounts of data to Apple, that they didn't keep this information, and had an arrow to the button at the bottom showing you how to turn it off (and on).</p>
<p>The horse is mostly out of the barn, but it was a fairly smart way to handle the problem after-the-fact.We totally concur. All you had to do was ask, Apple.</p>
