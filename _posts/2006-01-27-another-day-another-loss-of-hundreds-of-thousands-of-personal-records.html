excerpt: This time, they're medical records. From Computerworld:The tapes and disks
  were taken home by the employee as part of a backup protocol that sent them off-site
  to protect them against loss from fires or other disasters. That practice, which
  was only used by the home health care division of the hospital system, has since
  been stopped, said health system spokesman Gary Walker.Really, taking the tapes
  home wasn't that bad of an idea, although he probably should have dropped them off
  at a cave or something. The real issue is the inevitability that your information
  will (has!) already travelled from one of the hundreds of databases that already
  holds it into the hands of someone who can abuse it.

<p>Would fining companies who do not properly secure customer data help?</p>
