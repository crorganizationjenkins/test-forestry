excerpt: An early-adopter of an Apple iMac Core Duo reported 'video-tearing' issues
  with his new baby and set up a website to document his troubles. Fortunately, after
  doing some troubleshooting, he's discovered that Apple sent out the new iMacs with
  two different versions of Mac OS X, one of which has the video issues and one which
  does not. While he still hasn't resolved the issue to his satisfaction—the Genius
  Bar doesn't have the latest builds of OS X?—it does appear that the issue, while
  frustrating, can be fixed in software.
