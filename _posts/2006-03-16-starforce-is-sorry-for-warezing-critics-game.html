excerpt: Earlier this week we reported on Starforce, a gaming copy-protection company
  located in the cold, vacant womb of Ex-Soviet Russia, actually encouraging their
  site visitors to warez a game made by Stardock, a company that had criticized Starforce
  and its ilk's heavy-handed DRM methods. They even posted links to where users could
  download Stardock's game.

<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/starforcesorry.gif"></a>Earlier this week <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/complaints/why-starforce-sucks-drm-csr-idiot-pirates-160308.php">we reported on Starforce</a>, a gaming copy-protection company located in the cold, vacant womb of Ex-Soviet Russia, actually encouraging their site visitors to warez a game made by Stardock, a company that had criticized Starforce and its ilk's heavy-handed DRM methods. They even posted links to where users could download Stardock's game.</p>
<p>Well, a slight redemption for Starforce: they have apparently apologized to Stardock for, you know, being an anti-warez gaming company that encouraged people to warez a game. As well they should &mdash; if your entire business model is about preventing warez, then you go around and encourage people to illegally download games that don't use your system, you've really just skull-fucked your own eye socket there, squandering any credibility that your shitty little company might have.</p>
<p>In the future, Starforce should focus on their other tactic for silencing critics: <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/evil/authors-of-starforce-threaten-lawsuit-upon-criticism-151690.php">threatening them with silly little lawsuits</a></p>
