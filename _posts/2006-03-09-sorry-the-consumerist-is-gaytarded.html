<p>Have you noticed how The Consumerist has been loading slower and slower and slower? We certainly have. </p>
<p>It sucks! </p>
<p>Our techs know all about it (except how to immediately fix it) and things should be more reasonable tomorrow but probably won't drastically improve until the arrival of two new servers next week. </p>
<p>Until then, hold tight! </p>
<p>If you're sick of hitting refresh and not seeing any new content, may we suggest that now is the time to <a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/03/05/165927.php">switch to an RSS reader</a>?</p>
