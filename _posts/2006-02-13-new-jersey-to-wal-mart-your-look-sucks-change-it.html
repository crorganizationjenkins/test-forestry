<p>In Freehold Township, New Jersey, <a href="http://www.app.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060209/BUSINESS/602090424/1003/NEWS02">Wal-Mart's has been forced to clamp down on its ugly, ugly decor: </a></p>
<blockquote><p>The first thing shoppers at the new Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores on Route 537 might notice is what the stores look like.</p>
<p>Or rather, what they don't look like.</p>
<p>There's no red, white and blue exterior, sitting blunt and squarish on the landscape just like the thousands of other Wal-Marts and Sam's Clubs that dot the globe. Instead, there's a subdued red-brick facade, along with a low-slung roofline punctuated by dormer windows and hanging over a colonnaded walkway.</p>
<p>That's because Freehold Township, which was founded in 1693, has a 4-year-old ordinance requiring that new commercial businesses be designed with a historical look in mind.</p>
<p>"Every Wal-Mart is a cookie cutter," said Thomas Antus, the Freehold Township administrator. "We told them if you want to build this, this is what you have to do."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We hate these sort of town council schemes; frankly, we'd be surprised if a government-sanctioned order of acceptable aesthetic values was even constitutional. Worse yet, it stagnates the look of a town and impedes innovative architectural development. Still &mdash; anything that prevents Wal-Mart from dropping another red, white and blue aluminum shack on the middle of another pretty American town pretty much has to get a grudging thumbs up.</p>
