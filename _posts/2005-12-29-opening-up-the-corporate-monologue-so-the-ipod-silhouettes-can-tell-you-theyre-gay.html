<p><a href="http://www.thebubbleproject.com">The Bubble Project,</a> a rather fun public vandalism project wrapped up in a Sunday Times' worth of overwrought anti-corporate mumbo-justification.</p>
<blockquote><p>Once placed on ads, these stickers transform the corporate monologue into an open dialogue. They encourage anyone to fill them in with any form of self expression, free from censorship.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/07Camel-I-love-Cancer.jpg"></a>Of course, "free from censorship" also means open to stupid. As the Bubble Project proves, it turns out that the retort of most people - when given the opportunity to slug the corporate monologist right in the kisser and usher forth a rebuttal - takes the form of an open declaration of the catapult-like properties of their own erection. It just goes to show that a clever, enraged manifesto can make even the magic marker smell waves oscillating off of an advertisement for deodorant into a powerful anti-corporate political message.</p>
<p>I wish someone had handed me a copy of the Bubble Manifesto when I was caught illustrating my grade school comic strip masterpiece, <em>The Adventures of Fart Man</em>, on the back of the toilet stall door. If so, the month's worth of detention I received would have held all of the disestablishmentarianist allure of a political prisoner's.</p>
