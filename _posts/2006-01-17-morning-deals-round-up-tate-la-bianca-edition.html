<p>&bull; For the well-off goth who's looking to settle down, <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=7581639865&ru=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ebay.com%3A80%2Fws%2Fsearch%2FSaleSearch%3Fsofocus%3Dbs%26satitle%3D7581639865%26sacat%3D-1%2526catref%253DC5%26amp%253Bsspagename%3Dh%253Ah%253Aadvsearch%253AUS%26from%3DR7%26nojspr%3Dy%26pfid%3D0%26fsop%3D1%2526fsoo%253D1%26fcl%3D3%26frpp%3D50%26fvi%3D1">Sharon Tate's Opal and Garnet Engagement Ring for $25k</a> on eBay (the one given her by Roman Polanski). [via <a href="http://www.bayraider.tv/2006/01/sharon_tates_en.html">Bayraider</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Buy a dozen <a href="http://www.krispykreme.com/">Krispy Kreme donuts</a> and get 12 free valentines&mdash;each with a coupon for a free donut inside. The idea is, of course, to give them all back to yourself. Show your gut who you're really sweet on.</p>
<p>&bull; Target has the somewhat plain Merona Walking Coats on sale for $7 plus shipping. They look like something our grandmother would wear, but our grandmother is a pretty stylish lady. Direct links on <a href="http://slickdeals.net/#p6963">Slickdeals</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a> was a pair of Bluetooth hands-free headsets by Body Glove, but you've already missed them. They were big and ugly, but these are exactly the kind of deals we watch Woot for.</p>
<p>&bull; The lovely <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?sku=24053YR&cs=19&c=us&l=en">Dell 24-inch Ultrasharp 2405FPW LCD Monitor</a> is available for $879 shipped, a good-but-not-amazing price. But gosh it's pretty. (Don't get us started on the 30-inch model.) The <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?sku=20053YR&c=us&l=en&cs=19&category_id=2999">20-inch model</a> is $463.20, but it's been under $400 before.</p>
<p>&bull; The <a href="http://www.buy.com/retail/clearance/product.asp?sku=70015113&loc=&product=">Altec Lansing GT5051 Speaker System</a> is on clearance at Buy.com for $50 shipped.</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon is selling the Cowon iAudio X5 30GB multimedia player with FM tuner and voice recorder (and video!) for just <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009Q4UBK/ref=nosim/002-2776641-2416065?n=172282">$266 with free shipping</a>. If we weren't inexorably housed in Apple's colon, this is the digital audio player we would buy instead of the iPod video.</p>
