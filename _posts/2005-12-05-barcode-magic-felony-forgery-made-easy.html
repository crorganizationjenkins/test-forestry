excerpt: The Switchâ€”it's one of the great classics of shoplifting techniques. Traditionally,
  The Switch involves preexisting tags of disparate value. Properly executed, a price
  tag of lower total cost will replace the original, leaving the shoplifter with a
  lower price at the checkout. (If one feels guilty later, The Inverse Switch can
  be used to mark prices up.)

<p>The Switch&mdash;it's one of the great classics of shoplifting techniques. Traditionally, The Switch involves preexisting tags of disparate value. Properly executed, a price tag of lower total cost will replace the original, leaving the shoplifter with a lower price at the checkout. (If one feels guilty later, The Inverse Switch can be used to mark prices up.)</p>
<p>If one were to get even more <i>stupid cheap</i>, Ichiku's <a href="http://www.barcodemagic.com/">Barcode Magic</a> can be used to generate your own custom pricing labels for whatever price you choose. Since most barcodes use a uniform system, it isn't that difficult to make something expensive&mdash;say, an iPod&mdash;cost just a five-spot.</p>
<p>Of course, if you choose to use the $25 Barcode Magic to fleece a retailer, you may find yourself in the same cell as young Jonathan Baldino, who is now facing <a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/health/5449909/detail.html">felony charges of forgery</a> for attempting the very same maneuver in a Boulder-area Target.</p>
