<p>&bull; Aeropostale is running a clearance sale on clothing for both <a href="http://www.aeropostale.com/category/index.jsp?categoryId=2042419">men</a> and <a href="http://www.aeropostale.com/category/index.jsp?categoryId=2042418">women</a>. You could even get a <a href="http://www.aeropostale.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=2183143&cp=2042418">stuff bear</a>, though only your psychiatrist knows why you'd want one.</p>
<p>&bull; We do not feel the least bit of East Coast haughtiness when we say that we despise NASCAR. So when we recommended this <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2180625">Radio Shack PRO-84 Compact Scanner and Headphone Bundle</a>, do not mistake its NASCAR frequency compatibility as its selling point. That would be its price: $100, or half-off. [via <a href="http://techbargains.com">TechBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Get one of the brand-new 1GB iPod nanos from <a href="http://www.abtelectronics.com/scripts/site/site_product.php3?source=cj&id=22277&AID=10274510&PID=552179&cjsku=22277">Abt Electronics</a> for just $134.10 with free shipping, after using coupon code <b>CASFEB2006</b>. [via <a href="http://dealnews.com">DealNews</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a> is the Lowrance iFinder Map & Music GPS Receiver with MP3 player for $145. It even plays Ogg Vorbis music files, which may be a selling point or reason not to buy it, depending on your level of hippieness.</p>
