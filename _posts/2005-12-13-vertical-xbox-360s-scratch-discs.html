excerpt: Could positioning the Xbox 360 vertically—the way it's shown in almost all
  its ads—actually scratch game and movie discs? That's the explanation offered by
  one Microsoft customer service rep, who went on to explain that Microsoft would

<p>Could positioning the Xbox 360 vertically&mdash;the way it's shown in almost all its ads&mdash;actually scratch game and movie discs? That's the explanation offered by <a href="http://www.360insider.net/articles/12-12-2005/xbox-360-not-designed-to-play-games-in-vertical-position/">one Microsoft customer service rep</a>, who went on to explain that Microsoft would not be replacing discs scratched due to using to the Xbox in the 'improper' position.</p>
<p>We've already established that the Xbox 360 will <a href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/complaints/xbox-360-can-scratch-game-discs-140999.php">scratch discs if you move it</a> while it's turned on, which is bummer, but a pretty common issue for all disc drives. We hope this vertical nonsense is the byproduct of one CSR's laziness. Indeed, many responders in the 360Insider.net article have used a vertically-oriented Xbox 360 with no scratches at all. Keep an eye on it, we say.</p>
