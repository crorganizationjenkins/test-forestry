excerpt: While we doubt that we're being given "inside information" as our source
  purports, the new 'Delicious Discounts' program for Manhattan restaurants doesn't
  seem half bad. The service aggregates over a thousand Manhattan (and soon Brooklyn)
  restaurants, searchable by proximity to your address. Each time you try a new restaurant—and
  we don't yet know how Delicious Discounts can tell if it's new to you—you "automatically
  receive 20-25% off your first order from that restaurant," says our 'source.'

<p>While we doubt that we're being given "inside information" as our source purports, the new '<a href="http://www.seamlessweb.com/athome">Delicious Discounts</a>' program for Manhattan restaurants doesn't seem half bad.

Each time you try a new restaurant&mdash;and we don't yet know how Delicious Discounts can tell if it's new to you&mdash;you "automatically receive 20-25% off your first order from that restaurant," says our 'source.'</p>
<p>Now that we think about it, if it's just for delivery (it is), we suppose the restaurants would keep track based on your address. Anyway, it's got potential if you get a lot of delivery in Manhattan or would just like to try out new places. Plus, since the restaurants know it is your first order, one would hope they'd go the extra mile to impress. If you live elsewhere, our advice would be to move to New York. (Seriously, cheap, quality delivery is the best thirty pounds we've ever gained.)</p>
