excerpt: 'Business as usual for Verizon Customer Service Representative #1: a customer
  writes in, frustrated but polite, with a cogent complaint. When shopping for their
  phone, they were misleaded and/or lied to about the phone''s functionality by a
  Verizon employee. While the customer does not demand a refund, they are looking
  for some sort of acknowledgment that they have been wronged and want to know what
  Verizon is going to do in the future to prevent their sales reps from selling products
  based upon misleading and dishonest claims.'

<p>Business as usual for Verizon Customer Service Representative #1: a customer writes in, frustrated but polite, with a cogent complaint. When shopping for their phone, they were misleaded and/or lied to about the phone's functionality by a Verizon employee. While the customer does not demand a refund, they are looking for some sort of acknowledgment that they have been wronged and want to know what Verizon is going to do in the future to prevent their sales reps from selling products based upon misleading and dishonest claims.</p>
<p>Verizon Customer Service Representative #1 skims the email, then opens "Form Letter 1435 - We Appreciate Your Concern (Variant M).txt" on the Verizon CS network. Control A. Control C. Control V. Hits Send.</p>
<p>Business as usual for Verizon Customer Service Representative #2: customer responds to Form Letter 1435 pressing their questions. Verizon CSR #2 skims the email, then opens "Form Letter 1435 - We Appreciate Your Concern (Variant N).txt" on the Verizon CS network. Control A. Control C. Control V. Hits Send.</p>
<p>In this case, this all happened to Consumerist reader Christy K. when she bought her Motorola V710 from Verizon after being told it had Bluetooth capabilities that allowed her to use it for her own ringtones and the like. It didn't and her exchange with Verizon resulted in a series of completely mechanical emails from Verizon CSR's. They all "appreciated her concern". Of course, they didn't bother doing a damn thing about it.</p>
<p>Our favorite line from Christy's email? "I can appreciate that you are a company employee and cannot divulge the actual reason for disabling all the bluetooth features on the phone. Anyone can figure out that is it so Verizon can make money from people having to buy ringtones and send pictures through their for-fee services." Way to go, Christy. You rock. </p>
<p>Her full email and Verizon exchange after the jump.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since you guys asked for tips, I thought I would forward along a nice little conversation between myself and some Verizon robots.</p>
<p>My initial bitch was that I went out and bought a Motorola V710 specifically because it has Bluetooth capabilities and I wanted to be able to move files, sync my address book, etc. When I was purchasing my phone, the Verizon employee flat out told me "Oh - you won't have to buy ringtones or anything just send songs from your computer." I foolishly thought that to mean that Verizon had not in fact hobbled almost all Bluetooth capability in order to force people to use their for-pay services for ringtones, photos, etc.</p>
<p>I know I had 30 days to return the phone, but since the employee had either lied to me (or mislead me due to incompetence, who knows?) I was under the impression that I was doing something wrong or that it was a problem with my computer. So, before you know it because of that and having a life, my 30 days were up.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the saga is below. I will let you know if I get another automated response.</p>
