<p>Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com CEO, is a Toy's-R-Us Kid. </p>
<p>Even as Amazon <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1109859525763">waged its $750 million dollar lawsuit against Toys R Us</a> and pleaded with the Court to allow Amazon to stop doing business with the toy seller, CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife were busy updating their Amazon Wishlists.</p>
<p>They asking folks to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/ref=cm_pdp_profile_full_reg/?%5Fencoding=UTF8&id=BUWBWH9K2H77">buy them Star Wars merchandise from Toys R Us</a>, continuing to add lots of items right up to the week before a Judge ruled <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newjersey/ny-bc-nj--toysrus-amazon0302mar02,0,1681116.story?coll=ny-region-apnewjersey">Amazon breached its deal with Toys R Us</a>.</p>
<p>Gotta get that Darth mask, Jeff, put it in your close right next to the <a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/v9/communities/jeff-powers.jpg"><em>Austin Powers</em> suit</a>. <em>(Thanks to <a href="http://www.valleywag.com">Nick</a>!)</em></p>
