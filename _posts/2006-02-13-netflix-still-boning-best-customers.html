excerpt: We were a bit surprised by the renewed ruckus concerning Netflix throttling
  the turn around speed of heavy users, considering it's been a well-worn topic on
  Netflix blogs for at least a couple of years. But thanks to a new article on CNN.com,
  the issue is back to upset a whole new set of customers.

<p>We were a bit surprised by the renewed ruckus concerning Netflix throttling the turn around speed of heavy users, considering it's been a <a href="http://www.hackingnetflix.com/netflix/2005/02/netflix_custome.html">well-worn topic on Netflix blogs</a> for at least a couple of years. But thanks to a new article on CNN.com, the issue is back to upset a whole new set of customers.</p>
<p>Here's where we stand: we like Netflix, on the whole. It does work as advertised. We don't like the throttling, although we can understand the need to give new customers preferential treatment. (We don't agree with that philosophy, but we understand it as a business model.)</p>
<p>So here's a much better question: how would you fix it? Is the answer as simple as making the turn-around time the same for every customer? (<i>Thanks, Tim!</i>)</p>
