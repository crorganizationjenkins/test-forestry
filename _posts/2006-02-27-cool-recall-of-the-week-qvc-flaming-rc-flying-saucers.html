excerpt: We don't usually report on US Consumer Product Safety recalls. The news feed
  reads like the cryptomaniacal ravings of the maternally paranoid. A typical recall
  might start "Huggles Q. Featherbottom dolls recalled after small child manages to
  plunge the torso-sized plush  entirely up his own rectum. CEO of Huggles Q. Featherbottom,
  Inc. claims new dolls will feature an improved Anti-Rectum-Stuffing guard system."
  Meanwhile, when royal 'We' at the Consumerist were growing up, our royal fathers
  handed us Swiss Army Knives on our eighth birthdays and then sat around with his
  royal hands upon royal knees, chuckling, as we cut our hands to bloody ribbons fiddling
  with it. Boys will be boys, after all. The USCPS are bunch of pussies.

<p><a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml06/06531.html">But this recall of QVC Flying Saucers is too cool to not mention.</a> A QVC radio controlled flying saucer toy, capable of actual flight while a child makes all the appropriate extraterrestrial beepings and whirring noises with his mouth, has been recalled for spontaneously erupting into flame as it circumnavigates your living room. And this defect alone makes it probably the coolest sounding toy we've ever heard of.</p>
