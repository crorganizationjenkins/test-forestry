<p>"Don't ever underestimate the intelligence of the American consumer, because he or she is far smarter than we often give credit for. ... Garner a reputation for providing great customer satisfaction and you can charge a price premium..." </p>
<p>That<br />
s from,<br />
Satisfaction,<br />
 a new book by two execs at J.D. Powers and Associates, that place that<br />
s always giving cars shiny trophies.</p>
<p>The book<br />
s premise presents us with a paradox. If sites like The Consumerist are successful in making companies behave better, prices may rise. Also, we<br />
d have nothing to talk about. </p>
<p>Thank god that<br />
ll never happen.</p>
