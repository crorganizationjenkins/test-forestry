<p>The Global Pastors Network &mdash; a confederacy of evangelical protestants closing the spines of their Bibles on their laps and thumping back and forth in excitement of the impending Apocalypse &mdash; have announced their "Billion Souls Initiative".</p>
<p>Their aim? Open 5 million new franchises all over the world in the next ten years. Their goal? Securing enough Christian souls that the Rapture can take place.</p>
<p>And Christians wonder why people hate them. You know, some of us are having fun having premarital sex with multiple strippers on piles of ill-gained cash. Christians trying to hasten the Rapture is like the joykill R.A. flicking the lights on-and-off on the dorm beer/bong party at 10:30, petulantly insisting that people are trying to sleep.</p>
<p>And don't forget: Heaven is full of people like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cFkRgA5-Ps&search=john%20daker">John Daker</a>.</p>
