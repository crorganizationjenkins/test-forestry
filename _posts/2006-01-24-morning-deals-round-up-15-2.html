<p>&bull; We've never used the brand, but PCMicrostore.com has the <a href="http://www.pcmicrostore.com/SearchResult.aspx?q=kw:kroo+melrose&kbid=1008">Kroo iPod Video Leather Cases</a> available for just $14, shipped, including pink. Considering how ridiculously priced iPod cases usually are, that's pretty good. [via <a href="http://bensbargains.net">BensBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a> is a two-pack of EA Sports Hockey and Football Games&mdash;the sort that you plug into the TV that have the games built in, not unlike that Atari joystick that you glance at occasionally, but never play.</p>
