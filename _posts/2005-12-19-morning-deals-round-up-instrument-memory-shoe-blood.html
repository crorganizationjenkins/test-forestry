<p>&bull; Sam Ash has a 10%-off 'Friends and Family' promotion going on today and tomorrow. In-store only, and you'll need <a href="http://samash.com/images/newsletters/ecoupon_121905.html">this coupon</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon has the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006TI9WG/102-0392434-9450502?n=172282">SanDisk 1GB Memory Stick Pro Duo</a>&mdash;the same memory card used by the PSP and most newer Sony products&mdash;for $78, plus an additional $10 off if you want to use a mail-in rebate. Amazon is still claiming Dec 23rd deliveries for standard shipping, but go for 2-Day if you really need it.</p>
<p>&bull; Both <a href="http://zappos.com">Zappo's</a> and <a href="http://shoebuy.com">Shoe Buy</a> have sales running, with free shipping on every order. Zappo's has more clearance items, although you'll have to do some digging to find shoes that have been discounted more than a couple of bucks.</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a>: Mark of <strike>the Beast</strike> Fitness Wrist-Mounted Blood Pressure Monitor for $25, shipped. We know nothing about keeping blood pressure low, because if we kept ours at a reasonable level, we'd be out of a job.</p>
