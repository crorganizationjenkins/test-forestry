excerpt: If they were out of stock they could have sent it when they got some more.
  It's not like this is a product that is rare. But no, the bait & switch was 'cheapo
  printer or go to hell.'

<blockquote>This is about a bait & switch by Lenovo, from whom I just bought a $2,500 Thinkpad. I bought the computer from their site, paying $300 more than it would have cost on Buy.com because I wanted to configure it. And Buy.com had a <a href="http://www.whatsnextblog.com/archives/2005/11/buycom_the_wors.asp">fucked up policy</a>. </p>
<p>Anyhow, when I ordered the computer, there was a promotion on the site that offered free shipping, as well as an extra battery, a cheap printer and some other stuff. I told the salesperson I wanted the battery. He came back and said they were out of them and did I want a printer. No, i didn't want a damn cheapo printer. I wanted a battery.</p>

<p>Now the guy tells me he can't do anything about it because that promotion is over. "As for the promotion I do apologize but we are not able to offer it to you since the order was placed after the promotion expired, alternate promotions were offered as was free shipping."</p>
