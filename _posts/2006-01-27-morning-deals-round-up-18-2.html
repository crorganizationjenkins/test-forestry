<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/548166/102-0392434-9450502">Amazon's Friday Sale</a>&mdash;Because Thursdays are for suckers.</p>
<p><i>Uhmagud</i> including an electronic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000BQOATA/qid=/br=1-11/ref=br_lf_outlet_11//102-0392434-9450502?v=glance&s=outlet&n=548166">Swede-Atsu Massage Lounger</a>! We're pretty sure we can expense this.</p>
<p>&bull; Lowes is discounting the Black & Decket and Strait-Line Laser Levels by $50. Slickdeals has a <a href="http://slickdeals.net/#p6994">listing of all the prices</a>. With an additional $10 mail-in rebate on the Strait-Lines, you can actually <i>make</i> money. And remember kids, staring into lasers reveals a secret message!</p>
<p>&bull; If you're hankering for the newest Palm Treo 700w from Verizon&mdash;the one that runs Windows Mobile, not Palm OS&mdash;then it looks like the rebates for new service are <a href="http://www.buy.com/retail/wireless/product.asp?sku=160002150&loc=12435&s=22&p=1&zip=0">finally starting</a>, with a $300 phone selling with a $200 rebate for new activation. That brings you down to $99 for just the phone, although plan rates will vary.</p>
<p>&bull; Speaking of Palm PDAs, the factory outlet is selling the already-discounted refurbished items for an <a href="http://store.palm.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=1179667">additional 10% off</a> the already discounted price. <a [via href="http://techbargains.com">TechBargains]</p>
<p>&bull; Circuit City has a clearance sale <a href="http://www.circuitcity.com/ccd/specialBrowse.do?carriage=befree&sourceid=qIqiQ9oYVUrMAmEFxXmK&com.broadvision.session.new=Yes&affiliateid=39912901&context=outlet&BV_SessionID=@@@@0874718141.1138366550@@@@&BV_EngineID=ccdjaddglgikfedcfngcfkmdffhdffo.0">in their outlet</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a> is a Vivitar Vivicam 8.1MP digital camera for $255 shipped. From other stores the camera goes for closer to $300, so that's really not a bad deal.</p>
