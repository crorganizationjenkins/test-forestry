  You said it.'

<p>Washington State &mdash; unhappy with the stalwart, imperative "Experience Washington" &mdash; have changed their advertising slogan to "SayWA: The Sound of Jaws Dropping." You said it.</p>
<p>A slogan <em>eighteen months</em> and <em>32 marketing geniuses</em> in the making, the SayWA website describes the new slogan thusly: "SayWA is a distillation of the sense of wonder that comes with discovery. It describes the moment when an experience becomes emotional. Where the traveler is no longer an observer, but a participant. The SayWA moment."</p>
<p>The Seattle Times piece also has this wonderful quote from a Washingtonite: "Thirty-five years ago I smoked dope and probably could have come up with something like that." And John Browlee of Dublin, Ireland commented: "This is like a year and a half Washington, D.C. initiative ending in the slogan 'Say Dick.'"</p>
