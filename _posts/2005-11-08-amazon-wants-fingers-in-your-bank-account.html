<p>Amazon is asking its customers to reenter their credit card information today in an attempt to encourage participation in its new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/15399401/pop-up/102-0392434-9450502">Pay Directly From Your Bank Account</a> option. Skipping the credit card companies will save Amazon the transaction fees, but how will it help you?</p>
<p>Amazon Says:</p>
<blockquote><p>* You can use this option to pay for a wider selection of items than you can currently buy from Amazon.com with a paper check or money order.<br />
* Your orders will arrive more quickly than if you pay with a check or money order, as we don't need to wait to receive your payment in the mail.<br />
* "Pay directly from your bank account" is very secure and you won't have to worry about lost or stolen checks.<br />
* There are no annual fees or finance charges that you might incur with credit cards.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if you're one of the three or four cabin-dwelling upstarts who still inexplicably trust the American banking system, but don't trust credit cards then you'll be better off shopping through a direct transfer than sending a check or money order.</p>
<p>If you're a fellow credit card user—and surely most Amazon shoppers are—we think that Amazon needs to give us a reason to save them money (and miss our on our credit card rewards and protections).</p>
