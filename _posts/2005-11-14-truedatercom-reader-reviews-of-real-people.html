excerpt: Whether you're a bargain dating service buff or a connoisseur of the high-class
  matchmakers, it's always optimal to do some research on your potential partner purchases.
  Especially in online dating, where descriptors like 'loves movies' means 'can't
  hold a conversation' and 'loves seafood' means 'nice body but cephalopod mouth parts,
  including beak and tentacles.'

<p>Whether you're a bargain dating service buff or a connoisseur of the <a href="http://www.gawker.com/news/dating/lonely-without-a-date-then-sue-13701.php">high-class matchmakers</a>, it's always optimal to do some research on your potential partner purchases. Especially in online dating, where descriptors like 'loves movies' means 'can't hold a conversation' and 'loves seafood' means 'nice body but cephalopod mouth parts, including beak and tentacles.'</p>
<p>TrueDater.com offers reader reviews of online dating profiles from services like Match.com, Jdate, Nerve, and Yahoo Singles, in an attempt to minimize the amount of taking for the team to the traditional 'one.'
