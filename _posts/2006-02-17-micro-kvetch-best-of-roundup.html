excerpt: 's the week''s best:'

<p>On Monday we offered up <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/complaints/micro-kvetch-four-complaints-four-answers-154397.php">Bill Green<br />
s stellar mini-kvetch<br />
s</a> and asked you to chime in. Here<br />
s the week's best:</p>
<p><em>To any and all current and future Gap employees...or anybody, really - Do not refer to me as "chief" when ringing up my knit cap. Or ever. -<a href="http://www.clampants.com/">Clampants</a><br />
</em></p>
<p>Word. Don't let the knit cap fool you, we are people, not chiefs.</p>
<p><em>Ringtones: they want me to spend $3.99 for 20 seconds of a song I can buy in full for $0.99 on iTunes (I pipe directly into my phone's filesystem and make my own ringers because I'm a dork, but still, that the reality even exists is deeply troubling.) -<a href="http://www.danilocampos.com/">Danilo</a><br />
</em></p>
<p>You simultaneously frighten and impress us with your phreaking skills.</p>
<p><em>Dunkin Donuts: Please don't just offer me your old choices of regular coffee or chemically enhanced versions of "hazelnut" or "vanilla" coffee. I would much prefer nine different but equally disgusting flavors which are extruded by a machine as a thick syrup into a regular cup of coffee. That would be just swell.</em></p>
<p>Two sugars, splash of milk. Greaaaaat. -<a href="http://www.rikomatic.com/">rikomatic</a></p>
<p>The idea of making it before your eyes might be better suited for eateries making something healthy. Sometimes we<br />
d rather keep the magic alive and not know.</p>
<p>Add next week's micro kvetch's here or on the tips line and your acrimony could get front page billing.</p>
