<p>Thomas Kinkade, the painter of mega-kitschy religiously themed and militantly bourgeois schlock, tchotchkes and knickknacks bearing his imprimatur, may be a freakin' dirty bastard.</p>
<p>Besides making saccharine paintings, and defrauding and duping investors, he stands accused of peeing on Winnie the Pooh, groping a fan's breasts, and mocking Sigfried and Roy's stage show by shouting out "Codpiece! Codpiece!"</p>
<p>Brings a different meaning to "<a href="http://www.thomaskinkade.com/magi/servlet/com.asucon.ebiz.catalog.web.tk.CatalogServlet?catalogAction=Product&productId=204081">Sunset on Lamplight Lane</a>" and "<a href="http://www.thomaskinkade.com/magi/servlet/com.asucon.ebiz.catalog.web.tk.CatalogServlet?catalogAction=Product&productId=203731&menuNdx=0.9">Living Waters - Golfer's Paradise, Hole One</a>" adorning your biddy's wall, doesn't it?</p>
