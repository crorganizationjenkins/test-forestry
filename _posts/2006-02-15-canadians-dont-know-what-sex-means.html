<p>According to a recent poll of 3,000 students, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/02/14/060214202406.jhahap3b.html">Canadians are much more pathetic than previously suspected:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Young Canadians are digitizing their sex lives, embracing computer screens and touching keyboards ever so gently in lieu of person to person contact, according to a new survey.</p>
<p>Some 87 percent of 2,484 students polled at 150 colleges and universities across Canada reported having "virtual sex" over instant messenger, webcams or the telephone...</p>
<p>Fifty-one percent of respondents were female and 49 percent were male. Of these, 53 percent of students had sex over instant messenger while 44 percent made love to a partner via webcam or telephone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Jeez, Canada &mdash; no, you damn well <em>haven't</em>. Penis, meet vagina. Haven't met before? Then you haven't had "sex"... no matter <em>where</em> you've inserted your mobile.</p>
<p>It ends with this astonishing distinction. Our emphasis:</p>
<blockquote><p> The survey also asked people about their <strong>corporeal</strong> sex lives.</p></blockquote>
<p>Priceless. </p>
