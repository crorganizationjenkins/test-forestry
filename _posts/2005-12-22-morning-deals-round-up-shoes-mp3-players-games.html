<p>&bull; The clothing clearouts are getting nicer. The code <b>holiday2005</b>, for instance, will get you 40%&mdash;and sometimes free shipping&mdash;at <a href="http://timberland.com">Timberland.com</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; Or if Timberland isn't your style, try the clearance sale at <a href="http://kennethcole.com">Kenneth Cole</a>. While there are a few men's items, there is quite a bit more for women. <a href="http://slickdeals.net/#p6866">Slickdeals</a> has a listing of items and coupon codes.</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a>: The Creative MuVo 128MB MP3 Player for $25, shipped. If you bumped yourself up to the $50 range, you could probably quadruple your storage amounts. If you need a second, beater MP3 player <i>maybe</i>, but the prices on these things are in a continual freefall.</p>
<p>&bull; For instance, the 2GB SanDisk Sansa MP3 player can be had at <a href="http://www.circuitcity.com/ccd/productDetail.do?oid=134798&WT.mc_n=57&WT.mc_t=U&cm_ven=AFFILIATE%20MARKETING&cm_cat=BEFREE&cm_pla=DATAFEED-%3EPRODUCTS&cm_ite=1%20PRODUCT&cm_keycode=57">CircuitCity.com for just $115</a>, after using the coupon code <b>TDAZTESAAD</b>. Free shipping, to boot. [via <a href="http://bensbargains.com">BensBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; And while you're at Ben's Bargains, take advantage of their list of <a href="http://www.bensbargains.net/ktalk/1135254711,80192,.shtml">$10 videogames on sale at Amazon</a>. The list includes some quality titles, too, in between the BeyBlade and Hamtaro pap.</p>
