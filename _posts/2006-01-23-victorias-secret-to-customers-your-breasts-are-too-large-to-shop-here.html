<p>This just in. Victoria's Secret is launching a systematic attack of intimidation, isolation and humiliation... <a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/01/victoria_secret_holiday.html">on women with enormous cans.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>"I went into Victoria's Secret to purchase a bra set and was told they didn't sell in my size and to go to a Lane Bryant Store. Or I could buy a catalog for $5.00 to purchase my size," Babette, of Dewitt, Iowa, told ConsumerAffairs.com.</p>
<p>"I know I was discriminated against my size due to the fact that was told to go elsewhere to make my purchase."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/vsbreasts.jpg"></a>That last sentence can take awhile to parse, so I'll translate for you: Victoria's Secret is redirecting its largest breasted patrons to the Lane Bryant store in Iowa, forthwith known by all men by its classical name, "Xanadu".</p>
<p>To be fair, there does appear to have been a remarkable surge in nastiness amongst Victoria's Secret employees lately. But who can supress a titter when reading a quote like this?<br />
<blockquote>"Because of the winter rain, I wore a heavy black wool coat with pockets and was holding my gloves and car keys in my hand. While I rummaged through the sale bins, my gloves fell on the floor, so I put them and my keys into my pocket for safekeeping. All of a sudden, four or five snotty teenagers dressed in black come out from the woodwork asking if I need help," Anne told ConsumerAffairs.com.</p></blockquote>
<p>Snotty teenage boys hanging out in a lingerie store, asking stray women if they need any "help". Otherwise known as the Beavis and Butt-head pick-up method.</p>
