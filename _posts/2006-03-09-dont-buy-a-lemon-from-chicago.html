<p>Did you know that Illinois doesn't make car accident reports public? So if you Carfax a used car from there, you won't know it's already been around the block. Efforts to introduce legislation to change this have failed.</p>
<p>Apparently, the rationale for defeating the measure was that some of the reports might possibly contain errors. Therefore, no reports should be released.</p>
<p>Car dealerships are said to have lobbied against the bill.</p>
