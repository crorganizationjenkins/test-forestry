<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/porn_book.jpg"></a>What the hell is it with companies losing their customers financial information lately? iBill &mdash; a company the primarily handles credit card transactions on porn sites &mdash; has just admitted that the financial records of over <em>17 million</em> customers has been leaked to the Internet.</p>
<p>Luckily, credit card numbers aren't included in the leaked information... but that's about all that isn't included. Data that is included includes customers' names, phone numbers, addresses, e-mail addresses, internet IP addresses, logins, passwords, credit-card types and purchase amounts.</p>
<p>I'm not a porn enthusiast, so this doesn't really effect me, but Ben, you might want to call your credit card company, just to be on the safe side.</p>
