excerpt: Hey, AIDS sufferers! Better stock up on aspirin. There's just not enough
  money is curing your often fatal disease, says the federal chief of AIDS research,
  Dr. Edmund Tramont."If we look at the vaccine, HIV vaccine, we're going to have
  an HIV vaccine. It's not going to be made by a company," Tramont said. "They're
  dropping out like flies because there's no real incentive for them to do it. We
  have to do it."Of course, the pharmaceutical researchers deny that they're dragging
  their feet.

<p>Hey, AIDS sufferers! Better stock up on aspirin. There's just not enough money is curing your often fatal disease, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/conditions/12/25/aids.vaccine.ap/index.html">says the federal chief of AIDS research</a>, Dr. Edmund Tramont.<br />
<blockquote>"If we look at the vaccine, HIV vaccine, we're going to have an HIV vaccine. It's not going to be made by a company," Tramont said. "They're dropping out like flies because there's no real incentive for them to do it. We have to do it."</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the pharmaceutical researchers deny that they're dragging their feet.</p>
<p>The International AIDS Vaccines Initiative estimates that the annual spent on AIDS vaccine development is $682 million per year, or about half-again as much as was <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/rx/report.aspx?aid=723">spent to promote Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis in 2004</a>. </p>
