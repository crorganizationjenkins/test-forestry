excerpt: Here's a dry bone to gnaw on this morning. Some research company called BIGresearch—didn't
  spend a lot of research time on the name, apparently—has polled 15,000 folks to

<p>Here's a dry bone to gnaw on this morning. Some research company called BIGresearch&mdash;didn't spend a lot of research time on the name, apparently&mdash;has polled 15,000 folks to determine the influence of media on their purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>Now as you can see from the graphic, when you add in a product category things change up a bit, then change again when you add in age demographics. It's almost like <i>numbers mean something</i>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the internet barely registers in the general sense, coming in at number 10, while word of mouth remains supreme. You should all tell you friends about this 'internet'&mdash;they might like it.</p>
