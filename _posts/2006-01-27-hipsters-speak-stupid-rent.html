<p>i'm a little worried about the reprecussions of this. firstly, what would the landlord be able to do? i'm pretty sure he would rather not spend the extra $$$ to take me to court. would this look bad on my credit? would the new landlord be able to look up this information? what if i tell the new landlord i was just living with friends, and was not on any lease? would they be able to look this info up? </p>
<p>i'd rather be honest but this place sucks. there's a ton of things he never fixed anyway. why should i pay my stupid rent?Uh, because you said you would? [via snark's magnetic north, <a href="http://gawker.com/">Gawker</a>]</p>
