<p>&bull; Hide small bodies with the KitchenAid 12-Cup 700 Watt Black Ultra Wide Mouth Food Processor, now just <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BV6BWO/ref=nosim/102-0392434-9450502?n=284507">$105 shipped</a> at Amazon using the code <b>HOHOHOHO</b>. If you would prefer something more <i>jaunty</i> to match the gory remains of your victims, you can also get it in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BV7Q28/ref=nosim/102-0392434-9450502?n=284507">red</a>.

<p>&bull; Staples has a $.99 Sale on a variety of office goods, including Duck Tape, a 12-inch shatterproof ruler, and a Premium 1-hole punch. You've got the mixer for the murder&mdash;now stock up on torture. <a href="http://slickdeals.net/#p6889">Slickdeals</a> has the item numbers from which to order.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www1.macys.com/index.ognc?PartnerID=LINKSHARE&LinkshareID=Es5Ekr9eEBk-g6R.Yz.JdrOjpsg_VsJfDA&bhcp=1">Macys.com</a> is having their after-Christmas clearance, with discounts of up to 65% off.</p>
<p>&bull; Yahoo Small Business has a $2.99 per year domain registration sale going on for .com, .net, .org, .biz, .info, and .us domains&mdash;but only if you're a <a href="http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/domains/?p=CRUISE">new customer</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; Today's Woot: The <a href="http://www.woot.com/">Mustek GSmart D50 3.1 megapixel digital camera</a> for $75 shipped. No optical zoom, so we'd say pass. The entry level for a nice Canon Powershot is only around $150 (here's a Powershot A410 for <a href="http://dealnews.com/deals/Canon-Power-Shot-A410-3-2-MP-3-2-x-Zoom-Digital-Camera-for-127-shipped/104704.html">$127 shipped</a>), and it's worth saving up to get a real point-and-shoot.</p>
