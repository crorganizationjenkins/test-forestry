<p>Great chairs for that ass. But first, a personal complaint: We have written for Slate before. We have grown used to the long editing process, because we had presumed we needed the help. Yet, mull this quote from the 'Search for the Best Desk Chair' article:</p>
<p>"This sit is the bomb."</p>
<p>Oh Slate, how you've grown <i>with us</i>. In our dreams you drop beats of assorted density to front the rhymes of Garrison Keillor and Wilford Brimley.</p>
<p>But yes, chairs! Seth Stevenson's ass says the $950 'Liberty' by Humanscale (pictured) is the clear winner, with mesh galore, a strong reclining position, and <i>no knobs or levels</i>. Exciting!</p>
<p>And if we may recommend a more affordable option, we have yet to break the $250 <a href="http://www.officedepot.com/ddSKU.do;:10gga5344?level=SK&id=609880&N=61&An=browse">Office Depot Aeron Clone</a>, despite being built like we were intended to make a living <i>hewing</i> something.</p>
