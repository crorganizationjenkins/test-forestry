excerpt: Reader Alexis offers this harrowing tale of jetBlue's new New York-to-Boston
  route:Mechanical problems on Tuesday.  So we had to wait until they had a free plane.
  Last night they didn't get the plane back from NY (might have been weather related).
  They handed out Dunkin' Donuts to make up for everything. Right. [That's actually

<p>Reader Alexis offers this harrowing tale of jetBlue's new New York-to-Boston route:<br />
<blockquote>Mechanical problems on Tuesday.  So we had to wait until they had a free plane. Last night they didn't get the plane back from NY (might have been weather related).

<p>Also direcTV had not been activated yet. All monitors read "On Time" under departures and arrivals.</p>
<p>And they would not put the 10am passengers on the 11:30 flight, like they would if there were mechanical issues on the shuttle.  All other flights scheduled before and after us on Tuesday left on time.</p>
<p>Also, in Boston, they shut down the magazine and food stands at 9pm so there was nothing to buy/eat/read.  And no wireless internet (which they have in NY - except it only worked sporadically while was there).</p>
<p>Looks like somebody's <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/2005/11/flightstats_wha.html">FlightStats</a> are about to take a nose dive.</p>
