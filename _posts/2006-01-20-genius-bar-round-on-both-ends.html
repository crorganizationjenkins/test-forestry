<p>We've figured out the Apple Store Genius Bar: All the good service techs work in Ohio. That's the conclusion we've reached from <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/9038">Daniel H. Steinberg's heaps of praise</a> over at O'Reilly's Mac Dev Center.<br />
<blockquote>My machine initially came up registered to another user. I didn't pick up on that until Lance referred to me as Hector for a second time. He calmly looked at what was wrong, thought about what the cause could have been, and fixed it. I left happy and the people next to me with their iPods noted that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whatever, <i>thief</i>.</p>
