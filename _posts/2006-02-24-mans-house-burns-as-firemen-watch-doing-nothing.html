<p>In rural Missouri, you better make sure you're part of the firefighting club if you want to keep your house from burning down, as one Hispanic man found out, fighting flames with a garden hose while an entire fire department watched and did nothing.</p>
<p>Monett Rural Fire Department responded to the scene but did not fight, instead watching to see if the fire might spread to homes owned by members.</p>
<p>"People need to realize you've got to become a member. If you live outside the city limits, you need to join one of the rural fire departments," Fire Chief Ronnie Myers said.</p>
<p>Rueda offered to pay, County Sheriff's Detective Robert Evenson said, but the Monett department does not have a policy for on-the-spot billing.</p>
