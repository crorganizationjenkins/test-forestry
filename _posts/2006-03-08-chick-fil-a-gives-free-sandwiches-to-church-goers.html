excerpt: Chick-Fil-A likes God. If Jesus was poultry, they'd serve 'em up with BBQ
  communion wine sauce. The store is never open Sundays. The sponsor Christian music
  concerts. A Muslim sued them alleging they forced him to pray at work.

<p>Chick-Fil-A likes God. If Jesus was poultry, they'd serve 'em up with BBQ communion wine sauce. The store is never open Sundays. The sponsor <a href="http://cfahouston.com/events.htm">Christian music concerts</a>. A Muslim <a href="http://www.news8austin.com/content/top%5Fstories/?ArID=49360">sued</a> them alleging they forced him to pray at work.</p>
<p>Which is fine, you can run your business however you want, secular or  God-Lickin'-Good. We just wanted everyone to know that you can bring in your church bulletin and receive a FREE Chick-fil-A sandwich with purchase of a combo meal if you go to the Richmond Ave Chick-fil-A in Houston Texas.</p>
<p>Big photo and possible video of a Chick employee saying you don't have to be a member of a church to get a free sandwich, after the jump.</p>
<p>The videographers who sent this in say they were trying to not be obvious while documenting the interaction, which they certainly seemed to have achieved.</p>
