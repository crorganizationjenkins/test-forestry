Our perpetually cloistered and vanilla-flavored sister site <a href="http://www.gawker.com/news/video/stick-it-up-your-ass-fuckin-starbucks-160756.php">Gawker points</a> us to this fabulous rant in honor of Starbuck's Free Coffee day. An curmudgeon aka "The Kid from Brooklyn" rants on how Starbucks is stiffin' it to working man. (Watch out, the volume is kinda loud).</p>
<p>NSFW as there's a buncha cursing, to wit: "What do they fuckin think they<br />
re serving over there? Fuckin liquid gold? A fucking cup of coffee and a piece of pound cake, seven dollars? Stick it up your ass, fuckin Starbucks."</p>
