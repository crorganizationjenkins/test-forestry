<p>Not only do the rich have it better, they also write it better. Alex Kuczynki is some affluent broad "The Old Gray Lady" (<em>New York Times</em>) pays to scribe her mercantile extravaganzas. On her latest spree, on the advice of friends, she went to Vegas to partake of its wonderful lingerie purchasing opportunities.</p>
<p>She happened to visit the Las Vegas Victoria's Secret. One of their lifelike "sexy" mannikins is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/beatnikside/39936964/">pictured</a>.</p>
<p>Do you like Victoria's Secret? We do. Those fashion shows with the wings? Fabulous. They're so empowering and alluring. It's almost enough to make a fellow want to tuck it in, buy some negligee and strut it around the nightclubs like the secret goddess inside us tells us to.</p>
<p>For now, we'll have to suffice with the vicarious pleasure of reading Alex's report:</p>
<ul>"...the all-black room at one side of the store, behind an explicitly nondiscreet black satin sash that reads, in sequins,<br />
For Adults Only.<br />
 Inside, gaggles of customers circulate in the darkness, fondling cupless bras ($88) and crotchless panties ($68) and giggling self-consciously. There are pink paddles, meant (I assume) for gentle spanking, and sequined pasties ($18).</p>
<p>"In a strange way this Victoria<br />
s Secret store, which is presumably racier and more sexually explicit than any other in the country, is the most family-friendly. There is a boutique where Mom can buy her bras and silk pajamas, another where little sister can equip herself with T-shirts and cotton pants, and yet another where Dad can be secretly titillated."</p>
</ul>
<p>As Gawker notes, "Alex, we love you, but shopping is not therapy. Get help."</p>
<p>And if you need help, The Consumerist is here with two helping, hefting, hands.</p>
