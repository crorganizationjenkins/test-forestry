excerpt: DealHack has compiled a very useful index for online Christmas shoppers,
  showing the absolute deadline to place online orders for them to arrive in time.
  There is slight variance from store to store, but on the whole you'll want to order
  by the 15th if you get standard shipping and by the 22nd for overnight.

<p>DealHack has compiled a very useful index for online Christmas shoppers, showing the <a href="http://www.dealhack.com/deadlines.php">absolute deadline to place online orders</a> for them to arrive in time.

<p>It's a nice list, good job, etc., but on the whole here's the take home: start shopping now if you're planning on doing any online shopping. Especially from Wine.com&mdash;can you imagine a cold Christmas morning without wine to wash down the bourbon? It might as well be St. Patrick's.</p>
