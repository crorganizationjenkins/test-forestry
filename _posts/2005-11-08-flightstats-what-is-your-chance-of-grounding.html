<p>FlightStats is an online database detailing a variety of metrics about airline flight schedules, including information about average flight delays, cancelations, and diversions. You can use FlightStats online database to check the reliability of a particular flight, especially handy for those flights on small planes that don't see a lot of bookings.</p>
<p>If looking up every flight by hand sounds like a pain in the ass, WSJ's Personal Journal is reporting that FlightStat's information will soon be integrated into online ticket booking systems like the newly-launched <a href="http://www.pricegrabber.com/home_travel.php">Pricegrabber Travel</a>. While most carriers maintain around a 98% chance that their planes will actually leave the ground, it'll be nice to know that your chances of making the puddle jump from Westwego to Weehawken will be better if you book a friend.</p>
