excerpt: 'Watch this freakish Mc Donald''s commercial. Adults are frozen and a hatch
  opens in their belly. A child version of themselves goes out and gets McDonalds,
  brings it back to their hands, crawls back inside the hatch. After the door closes,
  the adult unfreezes, surprised that McDonald''s is in their hands and begin feverishly
  eating. "Feed your inner child" appears, followed by "I''m lovin'' it." '

<p>Watch this freakish Mc Donald's commercial. Adults are frozen and a hatch opens in their belly. A child version of themselves goes out and gets McDonalds, brings it back to their hands, crawls back inside the hatch. After the door closes, the adult unfreezes, surprised that McDonald's is in their hands and begin feverishly eating. "Feed your inner child" appears, followed by "I'm lovin' it." </p>
<p>We guarantee this is decidedly not your typical Micky D's creampuff dollop...</p>

<p>Way to make lemons out of lemonade (and then inject fat into the beverage). Slurping down a calorie bomb isn't a guilty pleasure, breaking your diet or immoral, it's getting spiritually centered and back to basics.</p>
<p>Frankly, the office drone actors look like they could use a little nourishment.</p>
<p>We'd have a very different ad, however, if instead of wiry stringbeans, the adults pictured were overweight or even obese...</p>
