<p>Here's the ladder we've put together to determine, by your votes, the Worst American Company.</p></p>
<p>Stay tuned for the forthcoming round 1 battle: <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/halliburton/worst-company-in-america-halliburton-vs-monsanto-156331.php">Halliburton vs. Monsanto</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. Face-off contendors determined solely by those who sumbitted <a href="http://snipurl.com/mu5e">here</a> and on the tip line. Don't see a company you're sharpening a knife for? Nominate it, <em>along with a reason why</em>, in the comments here and we'll be sure to put them up on the chopping block next time.</p>
