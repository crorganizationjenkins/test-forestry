The inherent nepotism of the Gawker elite requires us to point out that we've launched a wonderful new site, <a href="http://www.valleywag.com">Valleywag</a>. Their blurb: "Valleywag is a tech gossip rag. You people in Silicon Valley are far too busy changing the world to care about sex, greed and hypocrisy. But if you ever need a break, come visit us at Valleywag."</p>
<p>We at the Consumerist are happy to welcome Vallywag to the fold. The Consumerist will tell you how the Silicon Valley elite are screwing you out of your money&mdash;and Valleywag will tell you how they're spending it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.valleywag.com">Go check out Valleywag, we're saying.</a></p>
