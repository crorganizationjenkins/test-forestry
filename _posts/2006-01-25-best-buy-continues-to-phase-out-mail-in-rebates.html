<p>Best Buy is continuing to revamp their rebates process, according to this <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/060124/20060124005780.html?.v=1">press release</a>, providing 'instant savings' on notebook computers at the register, as well as rolling out a new <a href="http://bestbuy.com/rebates">online rebates tool</a> that they claim shortens the rebate turn-around down to just over a week.</p>
<p>Best Buy has stated that its intentions are to ditch rebates entirely by April '07, which is a move we wholeheartedly applaud. These are clearly moves in the right direction and we hope that other retailers follow suit.</p>
