<p><i>Update: We totally almost forgot to add this qualifying argument from one SE about why Bliss's products are totally overrated. Totally!</i></p>
<p>SEK writes:<br />
<blockquote>Here is something that has been bothering me ever since I got a swag<br />
bag full of goodies that included some products from the oft-praised<br />
Bliss spa. First, there's the "Sweet Orange and Spearmint Sugar<br />
Scrub." The orange and spearmint combo smells like the two worst<br />
flavors of fluoride that you used to have to sit through at the<br />
dentist's as a kid. It retails for $36 and I haven't yet been able to<br />
convince a friend to take it off my hands for free. All of them start<br />
off really excited by the idea of getting something from Bliss, but<br />
then after smelling it refuse to take it home with them.</p></blockquote>

<p>
Then there's their lemon and sage hair and body care products:</p>
<p>http://www.blissworld.com/shop/detail/BLISS-H507/327/</p>
<p>Otherwise known as the stuff in your bathroom at the W hotels. Smells<br />
like cleaning products and dries your hair like cheap hotel shampoo<br />
does. I'm all for food-flavored fancy salon products - but these guys<br />
have struck out twice with the orange/mint, lemon/sage stuff. It all<br />
just seems very _cheap_. I don't understand why they have a counter<br />
and Bloomies in Soho.</p>
