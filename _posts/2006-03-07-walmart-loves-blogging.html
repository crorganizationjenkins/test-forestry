<p>Walmart is drawing bloggers into the fold to help burnish its tarnished image.</p>
<p>"Wal-Mart is increasingly looking beyond the mainstream media and working directly with bloggers, feeding them exclusive nuggets of news, suggesting topics for postings and even inviting them to visit its corporate headquarters," reports the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>Exclusive tidbits of info are nice but don't get too tangled in the big blue skirts. You'll asphyxiate.</p>
<p>Disinformation is certainly more cost-effective than changing unpopular policies.</p>
