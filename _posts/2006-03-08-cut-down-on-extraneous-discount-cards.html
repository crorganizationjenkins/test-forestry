<p>Savvy bro <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/diy/card-combo-get-rid-of-extra-store-discount-cards-159049.php">Lifehacker</a> got turned onto a great idea posted at <a href="http://www.diymods.com/archives/2005/11/feature_lighten.cfm">DIY Mods</a> on cutting down on all those extra store discount cards bursting out your purse. </p>
<p>Snip up the cards and paste the bardcodes on one card. Endure odd looks from the clerks and just tell them which barcode to scan. Neat!</p>
<p>Save leftover plastic card shavings to build a thrifty "shopper's shiv."</p>
