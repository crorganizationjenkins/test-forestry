<p>Like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Web 0.5, we stumbled across Scott Pakin<br />
s automatic complaint-letter generator which simplifies and enliven your grievance submission process, an internet relic from 1996.</p>
<p>Type in the offending party<br />
s name or company and the program cranks out a vague and threatening letter insinuating numerous wrongs. Wrongs so heinous that they remain nameless, to comedic effect.</p>
<p>The magical machine seems to remix some of the best complaint lines ever written and connect them in a linguistically sound fashion.<br />
Friends, countrymen, lend me your ears, I come to bury The Consumerist, not praise him<br />
 was how one of the letters it produced for us started.</p>
<p>Why the letters may not resolve your issue, it may certainly be gratifying to befuddle your target into guilt and contrition.</p>
<p>We guess some things never change. The darn thing still works.</p>
