<p>"<em>Over the last 3 years, I bought a new vehicle, and I completely refurnished an apartment, including appliances & electronics.  Over the last 2 years, I've been inundated with crap mail for pre-approved credit offers, and warnings my warranties are about to expire, or that I "may be under insured," etc.  Usually, if they include a pre-paid envelope, I do the old rip it up & send it back thing, but I'd rather not get them to begin with</em>."</p>

Here's how to stop the bulk of the direct marketers: </p>
<ul>
<li>Stop Telemarketers. Sign up with the National Do Not Call <a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/default.aspx">Registry</a>.</p>
<p /></li>
<li>Stop Junk Mail. Register with the Direct Marketing Association's (DMA) Mail Preference <a href="http://www.dmaconsumers.org/cgi/offmailinglist">Service</a>. This puts you on 'do not mail' list, distributed regularily to all the DMA's members. The DMA counts most of the major bulk mailers among its constituents.
<p /></li>
<li>Stop Pre-Screened Credit Card Offers. Call (888) 567-8688 or visit <a href="https://www.optoutprescreen.com/">optoutprescreen.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Paranoid these tactics won't work? Good. Read this <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/telemarket.asp">snopes article</a> we cribbed from which explains how and why these are viable steps and not scams.</p>
