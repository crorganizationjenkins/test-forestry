excerpt: Who is ChoicePoint?
---
<p>Who is <strong>ChoicePoint</strong>?</p>
<p>Simply put, the nation's largest collector and parser of data about private citizens.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.govexec.com/features/0304/0304s1.htm">GovExec</a>:
<ul>"...It's illegal for a government agency to collect most of the data ChoicePoint maintains... Thus an unusual alliance has grown between government, whose appetite for information about potential security risks has risen, and a company whose acumen in assembling personal information has made it the supplier of choice for many federal agencies.</ul></p>
<p>"Mary Boris never pictured herself as a potential serial arsonist. But ChoicePoint did."</p>
<p>"Press investigations found numerous flaws with the data. For example, the online journal Salon reported that a voter named Christine got tagged as a felon because a "Christopher" with the same last name had a conviction."</p></p>
<ul>"<strong>It is the anonymous person</strong>," CEO Derek Smith [pictured], writes, "or small group of people, <strong>who represent the greatest risks</strong> - economic, physical or emotional - facing us today."</ul>
<p>Really? We could of sworn it was <a href="http://www.clubdesmonstres.com/killerklowns.htm">something else...</a></p>
