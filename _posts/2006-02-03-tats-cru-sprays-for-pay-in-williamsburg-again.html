excerpt: The 'graffiti' ad for the Hummer H3 by the Bronx-based 'Tats Cru' wasn't
  well-received. While it started out relatively clean (and nice looking, if we had
  to be honest), but the residents of the neighborhood of Williamsburg, Brooklyn,
  quickly made their feelings about "STREET.ART" known. (Did you know that "Hummer
  = Death?" We learn from graffiti every day.)

<p>The 'graffiti' ad for the Hummer H3 by the Bronx-based 'Tats Cru' wasn't well-received. While it started out <a href="http://www.jalopnik.com/cars/adspromotions/hummer-ad-en-mural-121409.php">relatively clean</a> (and nice looking, if we had to be honest), but the residents of the neighborhood of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, quickly <a href="http://www.picpatrol.com/entry.php?category=3&entry_id=1006&page=1">made their feelings about "STREET.ART" known</a>. (Did you know that "Hummer = Death?" We learn from graffiti every day.)</p>
<p>Now the Tats Cru is back, as <i>The Consumerist</i> spotted them painting this new ad for "The Order of the Serpentine," some sort of program on Spike TV. The only question now is what sort of street wisdom the hipsters will impart about Spike?</p>
