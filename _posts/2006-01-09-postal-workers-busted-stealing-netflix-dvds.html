excerpt: Colorado police have charged two postal workers for plucking out Netflix
  DVDs from the mail. According to court records, between January and March of 2005,
  503 Netflix DVD movies destined for Lyons, Colorado were reported missing or stolen.  Netflix
  told investigators the loss represents 23.33 percent of all DVD movies mailed to
  that postal area.Any Netflix subscriber has probably had a movie or two go missing
  over the course of their subscription. We wonder if disc theft is far more widespread
  than Netflix would like to acknowledge.
