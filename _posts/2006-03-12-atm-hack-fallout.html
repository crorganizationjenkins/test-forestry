<p>The ATM PIN block attacks has other consequences besides just your money getting siphoned off by scammers 2,000 miles away.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.danilocampos.com">Danilo</a> writes: "If people stop using their Visa checkcards debit cards and opt for the credit option, instead...stores will end up eating much more money in transaction fees...So, a bit of poetic justice for you. These careless retailers are killing their own golden geese."</p>
<p>Amanda, who got about $1000 in unauthorized funds withdrawn from her account from ATMS in Brooklyn, was able to get Bank of America to give her money back, except for $49 in withdrawl fees resulting from the fraudulent transactions taking place at non-Bank of America ATMs.</p>
<p>"I'm told they can take up to 90 days to do so because they don't do this until their investigation into my dispute claim has been completed," she writes, "I was able to request that they credit me right away, but I could only do so by asking a fraud department representative to send an email to the investigation department, and she couldn't tell me whether they would do it or not."</p>
