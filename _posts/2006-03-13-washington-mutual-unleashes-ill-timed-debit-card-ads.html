That'll go far. Every time a Russian scammer buys 1000 gross of babushkas using your stolen debit card info, you get three Lincolns!</p>
<p>Washington Mutual (WaMu)was one of the many banks with compromised debit card data. Rather than announce the intrusion, WaMu forcibly reissued cards and called it an upgrade.</p>
<p>The ad pictured is a portion of one of four ads in a in a two-page spread in today's <em>LA Times</em>.</p>
<p>Here's an idea: how about taking out a huge spread announcing the dangers of PIN Block Attacks to your existing customers? </p>
<p>Collect all four, after the jump...</p>
<p>The following ads, sent in by reader Pual, were on pages A8-A9. Each is a half-height ad.  Paul found the ads especially curious as this is the first he's seen WaMu advertise in the <em>LA Times</em> or the <em>Orange County Register</em>. </p>
<p><strong>3 Cents Back</strong></p>
<p><img alt="3cback.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3cback.jpg" width="436" class="center-img" height="752" /></p>
<p>Footnote: "When your account is open on its anniversary date, you will receive $.03 for each debit card purchase transaction made within the last year up to $250. Minimum balance to open: $1 ($100 at wamu.com)."<br />
<strong><br />
Free ATM Withdrawls</strong></p>
<p><img alt="freecheck.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/freecheck.jpg" width="436" class="center-img" height="743" /></p>
<p>Good to know ATM thieves won't be inconvenienced by transaction surchages... but oh wait, what's down there...</p>
<p>"ATM operator may charge non-refundable fee." </p>
<p><strong>Free Checking for Life</strong></p>
<p><img alt="forlife.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/forlife.jpg" width="432" class="center-img" height="743" /></p>
<p>"Free checks when ordered through us; select styles available."</p>
<p>Translation: Enjoy your sheets of cardboard.</p>
<p><strong>Why Haven't You Switched?</strong></p>
<p><img alt="why.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/why.jpg" width="434" class="center-img" height="746" /></p>
<p>Because we like to keep our money.</p>
<p>New suckers only, please, as the offer is, "Not available with Free Checking accounts opened prior to 3/11/06."</p>
<p>What an interesting date... two days after we started seeing this issue on sites like MSNBC.com.</p>
