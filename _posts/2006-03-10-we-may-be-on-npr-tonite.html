<p>Ian Chillag for NPR Marketplace's interviewed us this week about the "Worst Company in America" poll. The bit may be broadcasting tonight at 5pm EST. We should know more by 2:30pm. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/stations/">Here's</a> how you can find your local NPR affiliate. Or, it should also show up <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/">here</a>. </p>
<p>We wanted to get all Rush Limbaugh and do a bunch of paper shuffling and table-pounding but they're going to edit that out, because they're feminazis.</p>
<p>This should be neat. We're telling all our moms about it. </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Ian tells us that, "unless some supercriminal blows up all the gold in fort knox or something," the piece will air Monday. Stay tuned...</p>
