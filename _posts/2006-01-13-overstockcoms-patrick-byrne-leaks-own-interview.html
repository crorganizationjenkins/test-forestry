excerpt: Following the ins-and-outs of business is not our forte, but we continue
  to be enraptured by the kooky CEO of Overstock.com, Patrick Byrne. After making
  a call to investors where he assured them that he was not, among other things, a
  Jedi, he's now followed up by publishing an email interview with Business Week's
  e-Business editor Tim Mullaneyâ€”before the Business Week article has been published.

<p>Following the ins-and-outs of business is not our forte, but we continue to be enraptured by the kooky CEO of Overstock.com, Patrick Byrne. After making a call to investors where he assured them that he was not, among other things, <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/shopping/overstockcoms-patrick-byrne-not-gay-not-coked-out-not-a-jedi-145833.php">a Jedi</a>, he's now followed up by publishing an email interview with Business Week's e-Business editor Tim Mullaney&mdash;before the Business Week article has been published.</p>
<p>So yeah, yeah, who cares if there's some weirdness afoot in the offices of billion-dollar companies (at least if it doesn't affect our ability to get a sweet deal)? In principle we agree, but reading a Byrne ramble is high entertainment, especially when it's <a href="http://www.thesanitycheck.com/DrByrneBusinessWeek/tabid/90/Default.aspx">straight from the tap</a>. Example <i>par excellence</i>:<br />
<blockquote>Several years ago my friend and colleague, Stormy Simon, put a killer (David Meade) behind bars. For four years the police searched for a witness of whom they knew only a name, "Stormy" (which they mistakenly assumed to be a stripper's nom du stage: they thus confined their searches to Intermountain strip joints). They never found Stormy, and while Stormy knew some key facts about the murder, she did not that a murder had taken place. Stormy learned only when Meade found her to tell her that if she testified she "would end up face down in a field with a bullet in her head."</p>
<p> At the end of Meade's trial it seemed certain he would walk out of court a free man, but in a John Grisham-like twist, Stormy surprised everyone by showing up in the courtroom. Her testimony put Meade away for life. She is a hero to the Salt Lake City homicide detectives and prosecutors, one of whom just wrote a book, "Death in a Fish Pond," the climax of which is Story's out-of-the-blue heroism (the only other witness, incidentally, has since ended up face down in a field).</p></blockquote>
<p>Pardon the huge blockquote, but we remind you once again: This is an interview with <i>a CEO</i>. Perhaps the <i>best CEO ever</i>.</p>
