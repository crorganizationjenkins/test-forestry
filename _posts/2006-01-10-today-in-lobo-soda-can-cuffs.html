excerpt: Independent design collective retailer (we're just stringing together words
  until they mean something [everyday]) Elsewares is selling these beer and soda can
  cuffs for $80 a pop. Cuffs are borderline passe anyway, but when coupled with pop
  culture brand references, they very nearly cause our irony gland to liquify. That
  said, if you're going to spend four Jacksons on a pop can, please pick one with
  a nice design, like the always-classy Tab soda.

<p>Independent design collective retailer (we're just stringing together words until they mean something [everyday]) <a href="http://elsewares.com">Elsewares</a> is selling these <a href="http://www.elsewares.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=229">beer and soda can cuffs</a> for $80 a pop.

<p>But here's how to make this particularly cool, we think: The website says the popularity is causing delays in shipment due to manufacturing. We wager that means you could probably get a model made out of a can of your choosing and not just one of the pre-selected variants, should you take the time to email the creator and make sure it's okay to send them a rinsed-out can. (We don't know if this is at all possible, but for $80, we feel that a little customization isn't too much to ask.)</p>
