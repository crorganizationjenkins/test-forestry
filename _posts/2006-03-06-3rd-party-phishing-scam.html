excerpt: 'B.L. Ochman tips us off to a type of Paypal phishing scam to watch out for.
  She received a Pay Pal receipt lookalike for a watch from a company called Omegamove.
  The amount was for $395.85 and was to be shipped to one James Dickinson. Presumably,
  the scammers think you''ll see that, say, omg, I didn''t order a $400 watch and
  follow the link to dispute the order. After which, you enter in your Paypal info
  and they steal it. Paypal has confirmed the email to be a phish and is investigating. '
