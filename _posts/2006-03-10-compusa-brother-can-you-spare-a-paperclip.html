<p>Mike writes in tale of CompUSA exhibiting classic "bullet in foot" syndrome. </p>
<p>"Imagine my surprise when FedEx delivered a small box today containing (drumroll, please)... one tiny box of paper clips."</p>
<p>His shoppin' n' shippin' partay continues, after the jump...</p>
<blockquote><p>
Earlier this week I made an online purchase of a hard disk drive from<br />
CompUSA. The product, normally priced at $169.99, was reduced to $149.99, thanks to a coupon I found on DealHack. I also had a free shipping promo code that could be used in conjunction with the discount. But when I got to the "checkout", I was charged $5.00 for shipping. I "spoke" to an online CSR who told me I wasn't eligible for the free shipping; that perk applied only to purchases of $150.00 and above. In other words, I was one penny short. My argument that the item I purchased was really priced at $169.99 didn't sway him. He suggested I purchase paper clips for $1.00, which would then allow the system to waive the $5.00 shipping fee.</p>
<p>He was nice enough to provide a link to the paper clips, so I bought them. I still saved $4.00 (plus the $20.00 discount) and got paper clips to boot.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise when FedEx delivered a small box today containing<br />
(drumroll, please)...one tiny box of paper clips.<br />
The disk drive, according to CompUSA is being sent from the manufacturer; the paper clips were sent directly from CompUSA's warehouse. So, in order to enforce its own "no free shipping unless the order is over $150" policy, CompUSA incurred the added expense of an additional FedEx delivery to my home. I'm sure they have a very, very nice deep discount with FedEx, but still...why insist on a policy that costs them (not me) money. Couldn't their crack programmers add a few lines of code that lets the on-line shopping system know whether multiple items are coming from multiple warehouses?</p>
