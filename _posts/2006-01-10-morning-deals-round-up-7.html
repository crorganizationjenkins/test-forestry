excerpt: "â€¢ Suzuki is running a test drive promotion for their Grand Vitara SUV that
  can net you a $25 gas card. Start with this form, go test drive a Grand Vitara at
  your local dealership (or more commonly, just go ask the manager to sign it for
  you to save you both wasted time), and mail the form and business card to Suzuki.
  Hopefully, you have a Suzuki dealer close enough that it won't take $25 in gas to
  get there. [via Slickdeals]"

<p>&bull; We despise rebates, as you know, but they seem to be the norm when it comes to new cell phone service. If you can deal with rebates <a href="http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/00/10/00/15/62/37/100015623753.pdf">twice</a> <a href="http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/00/10/00/15/57/79/100015577925.pdf">over</a>, you can pick up the well-reviewed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000C1CHVC/ref%3Dnosim/bensbargaicenter/102-0392434-9450502">Sony Ericsson W600i Walkman phone</a> on Cingular (via Amazon) for free with a two-year contract. Of course, you'll need to pay out at least $250 while you wait for your rebates to not arrive.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://belkin.com">Belkin.com</a> has a 40% off coupon, which happens to be the same code we use for our luggage: <b>12345</b>. Sadly, PureAV products and sale items do not qualify, but even with Belkin's over-retail list prices, there are deals to be had.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.computers4sure.com/product.asp?productid=3854939">Computers4Sure.com</a> has the Logitech Harmony 360 Advanced Universal Remote for Xbox 360 for $92.95 with free shipping. That's not a huge savings, but it's a slight discount on a new, relatively hot product. [via <a href="http://dealnews.com">Dealnews</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Ski gear store Backcountry.com has an <a href="http://www.backcountryoutlet.com/outlet/promo/963/sas50.html">(up to) 50% off sale</a> in their online outlet.</p>
<p>&bull; And while we're talking about 50% off sales, <a href="http://www.nashbar.com/?PID=227502">bike nashbar</a> is running one as well on "over 50 items." Granted, like half of them are Shimano crank sets, but if you're one of those hippie dippie "I can get to work without driving my car to the cigarette store" types, then have a look. [via <a href="http://techbargains.com">TechBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; The <a href="http://woot.com">Woot</a> boys are having a breakdown. Not only are they offering a two-pack of bagel-slicing toasters for $35, shipped, they've covered the images in kittens. What's next, Woot? (Clearly, the answer is 'porn.')</p>
