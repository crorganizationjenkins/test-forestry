excerpt: Reader Gaby writes:[Chase.com's Business Online Banking] Keeps losing User
  Permissions settings. Daily. Administrator has to go to Chase online banking to
  set users access permissions (to view, or transact, and transact levels etc) for
  the various accounts. With many accounts and many users that's probably 50 clicks
  to set permissions. Save them, do something, come back and hey presto, no one can
  see anything anymore. Repeat process above. Cry. Scream. Do it again. And again.
