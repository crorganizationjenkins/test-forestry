excerpt: What's the fastest way to throw away customers' good will? Try equating the
  wearing of turbans with terrorism. It seems that vitamin makers Nature's Plus felt
  threatened enough by Illinois senator Dick Durbin's proposed bill that would require
  vitamin makers to disclose any harmful side effects of their products. As part of
  the 'Nutritional Health Alliance' (NHA), Nature's Plus sent the fliers labelled
  with 'GET A TURBAN FOR DURBIN!' to customers in a hateful mail campaign, complete
  with scary monster font.

<p>What's the fastest way to throw away customers' good will? Try <a href="http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_tol.jsp?id=1351">equating the wearing of turbans with terrorism</a>. It seems that vitamin makers <a href="http://www.naturesplus.com/default_flash.asp">Nature's Plus</a> felt threatened enough by Illinois senator Dick Durbin's proposed bill that would require vitamin makers to disclose any harmful side effects of their products. As part of the 'Nutritional Health Alliance' (NHA), Nature's Plus sent the fliers labelled with 'GET A TURBAN FOR DURBIN!' to customers in a hateful mail campaign, complete with <i>scary monster</i> font.</p>
<p>It's hard to decide what's more disturbing: The fact that there are still people in our country who think that all turban-wearing peoples should be associated with terrorism (and not the right-thinking association, 'driving a taxi') or that Nature's Plus would rather mail this repugnant, slapdash hate-mongering prattle rather than admit that <i>sometimes chemicals have side-effect</i>. We're not even pro-regulation on most vitamins and supplements, but Christ almighty, if this is the response of the vitamin industry to self-policing <i>maybe we should be</i>.</p>
<p>We think taking care of one's body is a sin that invalidates our stated belief in the miracle of the creator's intelligent design, but when we're in a <i>powdery</i> mood, we've had good luck with <a href="http://bulknutrition.com/">Bulk Nutrition</a>. (<i>Thanks, Headturban!</i>)</p>
