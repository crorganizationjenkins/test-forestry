<p>More signs point to OfficeDepot/OfficeMax and Sam's Club/Wal-Mart as being the retailers suspected of letting thousands of customer's debit cards and PINs to be stolen (see <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/citibank/atm-fraud-update-walmart-officemax-sams-club-office-depot-suspected-159725.php">ATM Fraud UPDATE: Wal-Mart, OfficeMax, Sam's Club, Office Depot Suspected</a>).</p>
<p>We're getting reports from all around the country. Several are from Southern California. But the problem is not limited to just that region.</p>
<p>Christopher writes, "My wife is a debit card holder of a Farmer's and Merchants National Bank here in Columbia TN and she just got a notice last week to reorder her card. the bank will be forcibly canceling her current card in April.</p>
<p>She uses her personal card for business transactions (she is reimbursed later) at all of the stores in your latest post. the letter that she got said the loss happened between Nov '05 and Jan '06." </p>
<p>More readers share similar stories, after the jump. Please send yours in to <a href="mailto:tips@consumerist.com">tips@consumerist.com</a>. </p>
<p>Christopher continues, "I hold the same type of card that is tied to our joint account and have not received any notice. I primarily only use my card for gas and food (non PIN # transactions."</p>
<p>We caution that his story and the following only constitute circumstantial evidence. Regardless, it's evidence, something this situation has been sorely lacking.</p>
<p>Brian from Texas has a story sounds right on the money. He shops at Sam's Club and someone tried to withdraw $500 from his account on February 8th. From <strong>Moscow</strong>. "The transaction happened just after midnite, and I'm certain I was not in <strong>Moscow</strong> at the time since I was sleeping here in Texas."  He writes,</p>
<p>"My <strong>VISA</strong> checking card was used, showing a $500 ATM withdrawal from <strong> Moscow</strong>.  I called my credit union and reported it, the same day I went to the police to report the theft and visited the credit union personally to order a new card.  My $500 was returned less than two hours after I gave the CU a police report number.</p>
<p>The local paper said between 20 and 50 people at four local banks (but predominantly at my credit union, <strong>Aggieland Credit Union</strong>) experienced similar fraudulant activity, most of it originating outside the country.  Local police are unable to do much other than notify the Secret Service and <strong>VISA</strong>.</p>
<p>Rumors locally are that a "local vendor stored credit card information on their computer" and they suspect that may be the problem.  I'm wondering if it isn't so local.</p>
<p>Yes, I use my card frequently (and PIN) at <strong>Sam's Club</strong>.  Sam's (ours at least) will not let you use it as a credit card and sign for it, but has always allowed you to use a debit card.   Buying gas I always use it as a credit card because I'm lazy and don't want to type a four digit PIN.  I've also used it at grocery stores.  Note that I have used my card this way for years and this is the first theft for me.</p>

Brandon of Chicago, IL writes, "Hmmm........very interesting.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago my card was locked down without warning. I called <strong>WaMu</strong> and was told that nothing appeared out of the ordinary on my account. Still, the card was locked. Tracked down a "fraud prevention" number and they told me my card had been <strong> counterfitted</strong>  and was being used to buy gas at multiple stations in  FL, utilizing my PIN.</p>
<p>Never been to Sam's...I'm a Costco guy if I have to be...but did make a purchase of pen refills -- using my PIN -- at <strong>Office Depot</strong> almost one month to the day before the fraud.</p>
<p>Interesting, and might all be a coincidence, but interesting.</p>

GenXCub from Las Vegas, NV: "Maybe I can find my documentation, but my existing <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> debit card wasn't due to expire until Feb 2007, and I'd received a new "gold" card in the mail 3 weeks ago, REQUIRING that I activate it immediately.  </p>
<p>I couldn't use my old card anymore (it worked for about 3 days after I activated the new card).  There was no reason given in the mail as to why I was receiving this new card.  I'd never merited one of their GOLD debit cards before, I don't know why they'd give me one now.  </p>
<p>Of the companies you listed, the only one I would have done a PIN transaction was <strong>Wal Mart</strong>, and the last time I used my debit card there was (according to <strong> wells fargo </strong> website) 1/17/06.  Other places are Target, Starbucks, and one of those post office automated stamp thingy's.  Everything else is at gas stations.</p>
<p>This article is the first I'd heard, and I'd be interested to hear more."</p>
<p>We're interested, too, especially if any of you can send scans of any documents related to your card reissue.<br />

<p>"I came home from a trip to find a FedEx Express envelope leaning against my door. I opened it to find a new ATM card from my credit union - DCU (<strong>Digital Credit Union</strong>). I'll skip the rant about my ATM card sitting outside my door where anyone could have grabbed it...</p>
<p>With my new ATM card was a bright yellow slip of paper:</p>
<p><img alt="dcu.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dcu.jpg" width="522" class="center-img" height="1117" /></p>
<p>If the fact that his new ATM card was sitting outside his front door is any indication of how concerned the banks are about your debit card security... Start hoarding shiny metal objects and colored beads.<br />

Jason, in a story not necessarily related to this present breach, sent in his tale of debit card fraud and lost $1300 in the process,</p>
<p>"In December 05 I received an overnight package via DHL from my bank, <strong>Wells Fargo</strong>.  Inside was a new ATM card and instructions on how to activate it, with no indication of why I was being sent a new card.  I activated it, chose a different PIN and the very next day there was a pending withdrawal from an ATM in <strong>Southern California</strong> (we live in Washington State) for $300 when we checked our account online. <strong> We called Wells Fargo</strong>, verified they had sent the new card, and complained about the withdrawal. They said they couldn't do jack about it since the activity was still pending, but they could tell that it was a PIN-based transaction. </p>
<p>So we watched our account and the following day there was another withdrawal, from a different account in Southern California.  We called them again and asked them to put a stop on all activity to and from our account, which they said they would.  The checked he numbers on the card used to make the withdrawals and it was from my old card, not the new one they had just sent me. By this time the first withdrawal had cleared and the money was officially sucked out of our account, so we could officially begin the process of getting our money back.  The next day there was another withdrawal, this time from an ATM in  Brooklyn, NY, another $300 (the daily maximum?).  We waited another day and a second withdrawal happened from <strong> New York</strong>.</p>
<p>I called <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> customer service and ask them why the fuck there were still withdrawals from our account when I had told them to stop all withdrawals.  The CSR said they had only stopped check activity, not ATM/DEBIT card activity.  At this point I lost my mind, asked her why the fuck would you stop us from writing checks when the problem was with PIN-based ATM withdrawals, and did everyone there at the call center have their heads up their asses?  She asked if my card had been stolen, I said no it was right here in my hand, and then she asked if I had ever given anyone my PIN "Uh, no" then she suggested I report the card as stolen and that was the only way they could stop the transactions.  I told her to do it and the withdrawals stopped.  It only took <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> 5 days and $1300 of my money to stop the fraudulent activity on our account. </p>
<p>The dispute process itself took about 3 weeks for us to get all our money back at which point we closed all our accounts and moved everything to a local credit union . One of their investigators told us they had sent out the new card because there was some reason to think that my existing card had been compromised, he wouldn't say how except they were reviewing places I had used my card to see if there were any matches.</p>
<p>A friend who works in the fraud department of a large bank told us they sometimes keep the old card and its PIN active for up to 30 days after you activate a new card unless you explicitly report it as stolen.  So they sent me a new card, suspecting there was going to be some fraudulent activity, and then kept the old one active so the fraudsters could do what <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> suspected they might do.  Really fine service <strong>Wells Fargo</strong>, way to put the customer first.</p>

We definitely think a California <strong>OfficeMax</strong> was involved in the heist as Helen writes,</p>
<p>"Hi,</p>
<p>In late Jan my mom's <strong>Mastercard</strong> [MC] statement showed $800 in overdraft transfers. She called MC as she never uses overdraft. They only told her to call her bank, <strong>Wells Fargo</strong>, and didn't warn her about current MC activity. </p>
<p>She almost immediately called WF: $4,000 in fraudulent pin-based debit card existed. ($100 from the historic balance, $3900 transfered in from  MC- trouble in itself as her MC rate doubled!) Between the calls to MC and WF MC still transferred $300 to WF before WF cancelled the debit card.  </p>
<p>The fraud was mostly $300 ATM withdrawals and some $10-50 purchases all in the <strong>Philipines</strong> in January (with one last ATM in NYC). WF's algorithms hadn't caught this, although WF was aware that pins had been compromised. They had told my mom "Don't worry, you're not alone" when she first called fraud.</p>
<p>Around then the San Jose Mercury ran a story on a security breach at an "office retailer."  My mom reviewed 6 months of debit card purchases. O<strong>fficeMax</strong> is the only retail store in her list. </p>
<p>All her other retail purchases were from small local restaurants or grocers. The only other chains were Arco gas and Marriotts. </p>
<p>Undoing the MC interest rate doubling took more time than undoing the fraud- that's another issue. </p>
<p>My mom had to pay MC the $4,000 to prevent a "30 days late" credit report flag. WF refunded the $4,000 once the fraud investigation was over. Given when the fraud started, she could easily have owed MC $6k- only the statement timing prevented that. </p>
<p>She paid because she had it in savings, but how many people have thousands of dollars readily available *and* can afford to lose access to it for the days or weeks until an investigation is done? Lost access is a harm. </p>
<p>MC "understood" my mom's concerns but insisted she pay to avoid the credit rating hit. </p>

Marcy experienced the following with her <strong>Bank of America</strong> debit card,</p>
<p>
My card was cancelled with NO notice.  i was forced to get another one.</p>
<p>I live in san francisco and my bank said that there was a scam going on dowtown of people's pins and info being stolen from ATMs in the financial district.</p>
<p>This was around the first week of Feb. 06.</p>
<p>When i complained, they said it was 'for my own safety.'<br />

<p>
I work for a large bank in the southeast as a CSR. (I'm honestly a bit scared to talk about this and ID the bank, as while I don't plan on working their forerver, I do need my job for a few more months. Let's just say its initials are ST. You're all smart people.) </p>
<p>In February, we had an internal memo that said almost 6000 check cards had been compromised, and that clients might be calling in about them. We were told to assure them that they'd been turned off as a 'precautionary measure' and that they'd have their new cards in 7-10 (?????) buisness days. </p>
<p>I didn't realize anything at the time, and while we haven't heard anything offical inside, I can't help but believe it's related.</p>
<p>Not as large as our friends at CitiBank, but...</p>
<p>Oh, and I've been giving out advice for a *long* time that you should always sign instead of using your pin. Just based on who's involved alone, you get more help with your signature. Visa tends to be more protective of their corperate image than ANY bank is. A bank will not hesitate to tell 2000 people "You're fucked. Deal with it." Visa, from what I undestand, will. </p>

Just writing to tell you that I'm a <strong>Washington Mutual</strong> customer in Seattle, and I was just issued a new debit card on 3/3/06.  It got switched from a <strong>Visa</strong> to a <strong>Mastercard</strong>.  Didn't think much of it at the time when I received a letter telling me I was going to get a new card, because it was expiring this year, but now that I checked - it didn't expire until June.  The letter specifically said that I would be keeping my previous PIN.  Looks like I should probably change that, eh? </p>
<p>Anyway, hope this helps with your data collection.  Thanks for keeping us updated on this stuff! </p>

I was sent a letter in early March about a security breach.  A new card was sent the next day.  No name of company was given.  I have not shopped at OfficeMax,  Wal-Mart, Sam's Club or Office Depot. </p>
<p>The bank was <strong>National City Bank</strong>, based in Cleveland.  I am in Columbus OH. </p>
<p>This can be a very big problem for people who have automatic payments set up on their cards.  I got my notice of cutoff only 1 day after a large cable bill went through (Time-Warner changed billing systems, and there were 2 payments due at the same time.)<br />

<p>
<strong>National City</strong> banks must have also been effected by the leak.  I received a notice last week that because of security reasons they would be reissuing my check card.  I called customer service to find out what all the hubbub was about but was directed from once representative to another and not one had any idea why my card needed to be reissued.  Then the next day I saw the story of the Citibank leak on Boing-Boing. </p>

Two days after <a href="http://onlineathens.com/stories/030306/news_20060303053.shtml ">this article </a> appeared in our local paper we noticed three ATM withdrawls from <strong>London</strong> totaling over $1,500.  I know of several other people that this has happened to within the last week.  We haven't had any transactions with OfficeMax, but have with <strong>Wal-Mart</strong>.  I'll never use the debit function on my checking account again!<br />

Hi there, </p>
<p>This may or may not be related, but I received a call two weeks ago from <strong>Keypoint Credit Union</strong>, saying that my debit card was in a "range of compromised cards" provided to them by <strong>Visa</strong>, and that all ATM and credit activity on my card had been blocked. They were very proactive about it, and they've since sent me a new card and PIN, although I had to wait two weeks for it. Fortunately, there were no fraudulent transactions on my account. </p>
<p>As for the source of the compromise, my last "Office Retailer" transaction was at <strong>Office Max</strong> last September. Our other 2 ATM cards (including one with more recent Office Max and Wal-Mart transactions) were not affected. </p>

<p>
Hi there. I'm a <strong>Bank of America</strong> customer and had my ATM card counterfeited and used to withdraw about $1,000 at ATM machines in <strong>New York City</strong> last week (I live in <strong>Southern California</strong>). The counterfeiters made 20 different ATM transactions, most for $40, at the same <strong>Citibank</strong> ATM machine, on the same day. </p>
<p>First, if this is from the same security breach as all the other incidents, then I can tell you for sure it's not from Sam's Club/Wal-Mart or Office Depot/Max, since I haven't bought anything at all from any of those places in the past few months.  I reviewed my statements and the only three places (other than at ATM machines) where I've used my card as a debit card and entered my PIN since November are: Robinson's May, Taco Bell, and the Post Office. One transaction each. Maybe there's been more than one of these security breaches? I noticed one other person mentioned the <strong>Post Office</strong> as one of their transactions. </p>
<p>Second, I have a qualified rant about <strong>Bank of America's</strong> handling of this situation. I suppose they haven't been completely awful about it, but they definitely haven't been great either. They cancelled my ATM checkcard without warning when they suspected the security breach (they claim they sent me a letter, but I haven't received it yet and I've already gotten the new ATM card at this point), AND they canceled my online access to my account at the same time, so that I couldn't look at what transactions were fraudulent until I physically went into a branch and spent half an hour to get online account access set up again. Also, they apparently weren't going to send me a new card until I called them and requested one. Which, if I hadn't, you know, tried to use my card and called them to find out what the hell, might not have happened until I received the "letter" they "sent" me on "March 4th." </p>
<p>On the other hand, when I called <strong>Bank of America</strong> in a panic late on the evening I found out about this, they were able to pick out all the fraudulent transactions and credited me for them the next day, which fortunately meant no charges to my account bounced. And every B of A employee I've spoken with has been very kind and as helpful as they could be (and, for whatever it's worth, obviously based in the USA). </p>
<p>BUT. Back on the original, evil hand, they have NOT credited me yet for $49 worth of non-Bank of America ATM fees resulting from the 20 different fraudulent ATM transactions; and I'm told they can take up to 90 days to do so because they don't do this until their investigation into my dispute claim has been completed. So, in other words, the money that the counterfeiters got, they're willing to give me back right now; but as for the money that <strong>Bank of America</strong> gave itself because of transactions that they're already pretty sure are fraudulent, well, those charges they have to "investigate" before they give back. I was able to request that they credit me right away, but I could only do so by asking a fraud department representative to send an email to the investigation department, and she couldn't tell me whether they would do it or not. The same apparently applies to insufficient funds fees (which I only through a stupendous stroke of luck didn't have any of). </p>
<p>Anyway. I'll be reading Consumerist for the news on all this crap. Grr.</p>

<p>"Got home today to discover a love note from <strong>Washington Mutual</strong>.</p>
<p>PO Box 2436<br />
Chatsworth, CA 91313-2436</p>
<p>February 18 2006 [odd, it's March 11th today.  Chatsworth isn't that<br />
far from me.]</p>
<p>Customer McCustomer<br />
address<br />
city, state, zip</p>
<p>Dear Customer McCustomer:</p>
<p>Exciting news! We are converting all of our customers' debit cards<br />
from <strong>Visa</strong> to <strong>MasterCard</strong>, and we are upgrading your debit card to gold<br />
status for free.  In the next few weeks, you'll receive a <strong>Washington<br />
Mutual</strong> Gold Debit <strong>MasterCard</strong> to replace your <strong>Visa</strong> Check Card ending in<br />
XXXX.</p>
<p>This upgraded <strong>Washington Mutual</strong> Gold Debit MasterCard will offer all the same benefits and more, with the same PIN.</p>
<p>With your upgraded card, your benefits will be expanded to include the following and much more:</p>
<p>* Double manufacturers' warranties for up to one year<br />
* Toll-Free US roadside assistance and worldwide travel assistance<br />
* Theft and damage protection for 90 days after purchase<br />
* Price protection for 60 days after purchase</p>
<p>Please keep an eye on your mailbox</p>
<p>Your upgraded debit card will arrive in the next few weeks.  If you<br />

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Doug Marshall<br />
Senior Vice President</p>
<p>There's a footnote, too, which notes that a Guide to Benefits will be<br />
mailed under separate cover.</p>
<p>Kind of interesting that it's dated almost a month prior to now and<br />
yet I just got it in my mailbox.  Looks like WaMu has decided to put<br />
their trust elsewhere... also, I wonder if only some customers are<br />
getting the gold upgrade, since it says they're reissuing everyone's<br />
cards and then says "upgrading yours."  If anyone else sees a<br />
different version of this letter, that might be worth checking out.<br />

This may be totally unrelated to the debit card news you've been splashing about, but 3 weeks ago (just before I started reading about the debit card fiasco), I got an urgent phone call from <strong>Citibank</strong> on my voicemail, asking me to call immediately. </p>
<p>When I phoned them, they told me that one of the vendors where I had used my credit card had reported that it "may have been" stolen, and they wished to re-issue a new credit card to me right away. I asked them WHICH vendor had reported that the card had (er. MAY have) been stolen, as I wished to avoid them in the future. They told me that "they can't release that information." Which, frankly, struck me as damned odd. Nonetheless, I agreed to have a new credit card issued to me. In a moment of astonishing cheapness (and a nice Consumerist moment), they said it would be 5 to 10 days to get the card by mail; I laughed at the phone-troll and said that there was no way I was waiting 10 days to get a new credit card when I hasn't had anything to do with the loss of my information, after which she relented and said they would send it UPS overnight. </p>
<p>In terms of the debit card discussion, this MAY be a red herring, in that I don't have a Citibank-issued debit card; I have a 100% pure <strong>MasterCard</strong> for its chewy credity goodness. But, I *do* shop at <strong>OfficeMax</strong>, and I *have* used this card there before (as a credit card), so the timing seems very suspicious. I sure would be interested to hear if other "credit-only" Citibank customers were affected; if so, the scope of the problem may be even larger than what you've reported. Or, heck, it could be totally legit and the restaurant down the street had a disgruntled employee issue. </p>
<p>Thought I'd add to the steaming pile of knowledge y'all are wading hip-deep in. </p>
<p>Cheers! </p>
<p>  ..Chris..<br />

Rhys:</p>
<p>"Here in Iowa , my wife and I got home Friday to find new Wells Fargo debit cards for each of us - I wasn't due for a replacement until January, and I'm not sure when hers was due. A letter was included stating that the numbers may have been stolen and this was precautionary. We haven't noticed any strange things on the account yet (we check mutiple times daily anyway) but have changed our pins already since I had been reading this topic for the last few days. After I told her about this she called Wells Fargo to ensure our old cards would be disabled as soon as we activated the new ones, but didn't get any more information on why this had happened. We have a habit of using our cards as debit cards, but that's quickly changed. We've ranged around the midwest a bit since November, and have visited several of the stores listed. -Rhys"<br />

Paul:</p>
<p>"I received a reissue of my <strong>Visa</strong> debit card from <strong>Washington Mutual</strong>. I felt that the wording of the note is very strange. I can type it up or scan it for you guys if you want. I live in <strong>Southern California</strong>, if that helps.</p>
<p>The re-issued cards are <strong>MasterCards, instead of Visas</strong>, which we always have had at <strong>WaMu</strong>.</p>
<p>What's funny is I remember asking my banker what would happen if my debit card was used fraudulently, and they said something like, "well, you'd be responsible, that's why we recommend you get a credit card." They had no option to get a strictly ATM card, rather than a debit card.</p>

Marco:</p>
<p>"Howdy,</p>
<p>I saw your article on recent debit card reissues via a link from BoingBoing. I just got a new debit card from <strong>Washington Mutual</strong>. The letter included reads "We are providing you with this replacement card because we have reason to believe the the information on your <strong>Washington Mutual Gold Debit MasterCard</strong> may be at risk of fraudulent activity. Although we are unaware of any fraudulent use of your card as of the date of this letter, please activate this card immediately and destroy your old card for your protection."</p>
<p>I didn't connect this with the recent story until I saw your article. I believe <strong>Washington Mutual</strong> partners with <strong>Citibank</strong> for these cards"<br />

Phoebe:</p>
<p>"Hi,</p>
<p>I just read your post "ATM Fraud UPDATE: Wal-Mart, OfficeMax, Sam's<br />
Club, Office Depot Suspected" and wanted to let you know that I am a<br />
<strong>Washington Mutual</strong> customer and was recently sent a new debit card when my old one still has months until it expires.  The letter that was sent with it said that there may have been fraudulent activity in my account and that is why they were sending me another one.  I got worried and called (also called because I traveled to Costa Rica last year and <strong>Washington Mutual</strong> decided to turn off my card because I didn't tell them I was traveling, however I had never had a problem using my card before in France, Japan, or Singapore, but that's another story.)</p>
<p>Anyway when I got someone on the phone they told me that there wasn't<br />
any fraud in my account (neither had their been in Costa Rica) but<br />
that they thought that all of their customers deserved gold card<br />
instead of the previously issued blue ones.  Um waste of money!  Maybe they wouldn't need to charge $30 for an over draft if they didn't decided to change the color of their cards for what I thought was no reason.  Maybe the reissue of the <strong>WaMu</strong> gold cards has something to do with this however?  BTW the gold card doesn't get me anything more than the blue one I had for years before.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

<p>"Thanks so much for staying on top of this story.  It is really disturbing how little MSM press this has gotten.  We'd really like to know just how far reaching this is and what retailers plan to do about it. It irks us that they won't disclose which retailer or third party transaction processor is at fault.</p>
<p>It's been over a week since our money went missing.  Our bank (<strong>Suntrust</strong>) has been really great.  They redeposited the funds to our account within 48 hours.  They told us we didn't need to file a police report because of the sheer volume of cases in our area that were already reported.</p>
<p>We still haven't gotten our replacement cards yet, so we have no way to get cash other than checks, which ironically means we have to make charges on our traditional credit cards.  I'd like to also mention that <strong>Suntrust</strong> did, about a month ago, pull the same thing other banks have done; cancelling good check cards and send out new ones.  A friend of mine had gone to lunch, went to pay and had her card decline even though there was money in her bank account and her card had not expired.  The only explanation she got from Suntrust at that time was they were cutting off an "old" version of the check cards and sending out new ones.  Her main issue was that they cut off her card before she received a new card.  Since we bank at the same bank and because I too had the "old" card, I asked if the same thing would happen to me.  They said it could but would send me a new card right away just in case. No mention of fraud at all.  Unfortunately for us, I got the new card but my husband's card was the one that got nabbed.  Now we'll both get new cards.  That will make new two check cards for me within one month.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for all the great work!  For all of us that have gotten taken, we're still paying attention.</p>
<p>Sincerly, <br />

<p>"I bank with National City and recieved a letter then a new debit card  would arrive. But heres what really is stupid is that of course my debit card is one of  two tied to our joint checking.. The bank only reissused my card, they didn't suggest closing down our checking account!     Hello wouldn't that have made sense too CLOSE the checking account too! Why invite trouble and cause stress, the bank wasn;t going to tell me anything they didn;t have too I had to ask a million questions, of course I read everything I could on the banks web site on fraud and I as amazes on what they refused to tell me untill I grilled them on the policy."<br />

<p>"I know you guys don't care much for personal anecdoes (or so I read), but I thought you might be interested to know that my bank, Wachovia (I'm in North Carolina), sent me a new debit card in the mail, unsolicited by me, with a letter that said they had been informed by VISA that "an incident involving unauthorized access into third party merchant systems had occurred," and that "based on the information provided by Visa, it has been determined that [my] Visa Check Card number, name as it appears on the card, expiration date, and magnetic strip data were potentially exposed."</p>
<p>The use of my new card will deactivate my old one. The letter also reminds me that I'm not responsible for any fraudulent purchases under "Wachovia's Zero Liability Fraud protection policy," plus more marketing stuff. Fortunately, I've never had to submit any claims under this policy, but I can't vouch how "zero liability" it really is. Interestingly, my card has the same account number, and I assume the same pin number until I change it so I guess the new magnetic strip makes a difference? In any case, it's cool that my bank caught wind of this pretty quickly and sent out new debit cards to their customers (presumably all their debit card customers - no small feat in a few days)."<br />

<p>"Here's my report of a debit card reissue.<br />
BB&T bank sent me a letter the other day saying (in part) this:</p>
<p>"Visa U.S.A. notified BB&T and other financial institutions of a security breach that affected the data base of a U.S. merchant. This breach MAY (emphasis theirs) have put a very small percentage of BB&T cardholder information at risk. Your BB&T Check Card was identified as one of the cards that may have been affected.</p>
<p>This breach was not the result of any actions taken by BB&T; it does not mean that there has been an unauthorized transaction on your account. However, as a precaution, we are ordering a new BB&T Check Card for you. The card will have a different number, but for your convenience, your Personal Identification Number (PIN) will remain the same. You should receive your new BB&T Check Card prior to March 28, 2006."</p>
<p>So, step #1? I Google "Visa database breach" to see what's up. Seeing breached from last July, I modify the search, adding 2006 to the above, and found your site.<br />
Step #2? I logged into BB&T online banking to see my statement and I find no suspicious activity and breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>There were lots of Sam's Club transactions, not surprisingly, that's where I get my gas. From one of the entries on somebody's page it looks like I can skip the PIN part when buying gas, so I might do that...</p>
<p>You can bet that I'll change the PIN ASAP!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<ul>"This week, 2 things happened to my girlfriend and I;</p>
<p>First, she was buying a few items at a pharmacy and they declined her Bank of America debit card. She went to the nearest BofA and they told her that her atm card was compromised. They told her they'd issue her a new one and she would receive it in the mail in 7 to 10 days. My girlfriend insisted on finding out the source of the compromise, but BofA told her it wasn't her business. Enraged, she told me also there was no communication from BofA telling her that her debit card had been shut down, no email, phone call or letter. This is a complete inconvenience for a person who uses their debit card daily.</p>
<p>Then on Saturday night I went to a BofA atm and it declined my transaction, after using it only a few hours before for dry cleaning, gas, breakfast. I went to another atm down the street and it also declined my call. After repeated attempts at calling BofA, I could not get a human on the phone! Their system told me I could get an associate on the phone between the hours of 7am and 10pm and hung up on me, but this was only after 7pm PST! Imagine if I had an emergency, this is one of the largest banks in the country and I can't get a person on the phone on the weekend? So I called the next morning and their atm dept told me they detected an abnormality with the gas station I went to that afternoon and froze my card. After verifying who I was, they unblocked my card.</p>
<p> I wanted to know if there was any other word of this compromise from anyone else this week?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ross"</p>
