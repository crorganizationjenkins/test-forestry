excerpt: Mail-in rebates are a chump's game, and on the whole, we recommend against
  them. (That's one of the reason you'll so few MIR offers in our Deals Rounds Ups;
  The other is that half the time they just don't work.)

<p>Mail-in rebates are a chump's game, and on the whole, we recommend against them. (That's one of the reason you'll so few MIR offers in our Deals Rounds Ups; The other is that half the time they just <i>don't work</i>.)</p>
<p>But sometimes you just can't resist, or find a good price on an item that just happens to have a rebate anyway. How can you make yourself remember to send these things in?</p>
<p>Try these two easy, but 100% effective shophacks *:</p>
<p>1. For in store purchases, fill out the rebate form before you play with your new toy. That's it&mdash;simple, but guaranteed to work, if you can wring just the slightest amount of self-control out of yourself.</p>
<p>2. For online purchases (and these are where we always screw up), set yourself a reminder in <a href="http://backpackit.com">Backpack</a>. Backpack is a free, online organizing tool that can send you an email at a pre-specified time. It's stupid easy&mdash;this one in the screenshot took us exactly 8 seconds (although we already had the rebate page URL in our cut-and-paste buffer). Be sure to put all the information you need in the reminder, including links to rebate forms and online receipts.</p>
<p>Now if only Backpack would send SMS messages to our phones. (They can already send email to phones, but that's not as ubiquitous.)</p>
<p><i>* Yes, we're succumbing to the 'all tricks are hacks' trend. Shut up already. (Or as we call, try a 'not talking hack.')</i></p>
<p><i>Update:</i> Smarty socks sister site Lifehacker posted a link to this story and her readers added some great additional ideas. <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/shopping/consumerist-never-forget-to-claim-your-rebate-again-141383.php">Check it out.</a></p>
