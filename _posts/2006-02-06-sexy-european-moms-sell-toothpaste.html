<p>Speaking of naked Europeans working their bodies to sell you their products, check out <a href="http://ad-rag.com/127355.php">this absolutely astonishing ad for Beverly Hills Toothpaste.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.stayfreemagazine.org/2006/02/can_any_sex_sel.html">Stay Free claims</a> that "even if your mother is beautiful, there's nothing sexy about her". I don't know, man -  my mom never looked like <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>Other thoughts:</p>

<ul /></p>
<li>James certainly can rattle off a number of official sources when trying to make a point to his hot, naked mum, can't he?
</li>
<p></p>
<li>This advertisement, including a variation of the dental hygiene wording ("Bad diseases can start in your..."), was originally rejected by a British douche company as being too disconcerting
</li>
<p></p>
<li>Look at the grin on the kid's face: a young boy's dismay at being dragged to do a toothpaste advertisement when he could be at home stuffing his mug with crisps and playing Nintendo suddenly blossoms into one of those definitive moments in a male's life - namely, the first time he sees a beautiful woman naked, wet and jiggling.
