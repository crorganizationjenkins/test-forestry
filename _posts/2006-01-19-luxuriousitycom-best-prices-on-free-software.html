excerpt: Open source software is great for cheapskates, because so often those commie
  programmers give away perfectly saleable software for free. The licenses under which
  much free software is released are pretty liberal, but were probably not meant to
  be so free as to let clumsily-named websites sell the software as their own.

<p>Open source software is great for cheapskates, because so often those commie programmers give away perfectly saleable software for free. The licenses under which much free software is released are pretty liberal, but were probably not meant to be so free as to let <a href="http://www.luxuriousity.com/">clumsily-named websites sell the software as their own</a>.</p>
<p>For only $30, Luxuriousity will sell you a copy of their <a href="http://www.luxuriousity.com/photodownload.htm">Photo Editor Software</a>, which we have on good word from a random <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a> commentor that this software is actually The GIMP, the infamous completely-free competitor to Photoshop. (They also throw in two identical images of a smiling old man with glasses, who we have on good word from the police takes telephoto pictures of boys in swim trunks.)</p>
<p>It might be legal to repackage and resell many of these software packages, but that's not the point. Luxuriousity isn't adding the least bit of value beyond pressing a CD. If you choose their 'Instant Download' options, you've literally paid $30 to download software from the internet that you could get from thousands of other sites for free.</p>
