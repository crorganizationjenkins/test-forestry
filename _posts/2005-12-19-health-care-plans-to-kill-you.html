excerpt: 'In less than five paragraphs, Stay Free Magazine''s "How Hip Health Plan
  Breeds Superbugs" chillingly describes the nightmare plutopia in which we currently
  liveâ€”a world where not only are you chipperly reamed for twice the cost of your
  sinus medication, but are also softened up like veal for the slurping protuberances
  of a hyper-immune race of super bacteria.No, the reason HIP covers less than a full
  supply is because it wants two co-payments out of me. At $30 each, that makes the
  drug $60. This not only makes the drug unduly expensive, but it encourages patients
  not to take their full course of antibiotics.... which, if you know anything about
  antibiotics, is dangerous from a public health perspective, because it can lead
  to drug-resistant bacteria.Which, of course, is HIP''s entire insidious plot. A
  pallid, gel-like population of wheezing mouth breathers ridden through the streets
  by antibiotic junky bacteria jonesin'' for a fix. And who are these superbugs? As
  any reader who is familiar with the direct-to-video oeuvre of Brian Yuzna in the
  early 90''s will be quick to realize, these are the board of directors of HIP Healthcare
  itself. '

<p>One ancillary note: I have several hundred emails in my Spam Folder from friendly Zimbabweans who will all (with great politeness) attest that "Augmentin" does not, in fact, augment your <i>tonsils</i>.</p>
