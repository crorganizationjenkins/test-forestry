excerpt: Very nearly at the beginning of our existence as a weblog, we posted a link
  to Amazon Credits You, a site that helps you watch out for potential savings if
  Amazon drops their price on an item within the 30-day price guarantee window. We
  went back today to dig up the name of the site so we could punch in some numbers
  (see, even we use our tips; we aren't totally phoning it in) and discovered the
  site has been changed to Refund Please.

<p>Very nearly at the beginning of our existence as a weblog, we posted a link to <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/deals/free-service-amazon-credits-you-145847.php">Amazon Credits You</a>, a site that helps you watch out for potential savings if Amazon drops their price on an item within the 30-day price guarantee window. We went back today to dig up the name of the site so we could punch in some numbers (see, even we use our tips; we aren't totally phoning it in) and discovered the site has been changed to <a href="http://refundplease.com">Refund Please</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that the creators of the site intend to add other price-match services besides Amazon, although for the moment that's the only retailer they support. Still, it's a fine, free service, and we wouldn't want you to miss out on any money if possible.</p>
