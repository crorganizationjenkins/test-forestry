<p><a href="http://www.reemer.com/">Kareem</a> sends a story from his buddy who had trouble getting the promised free e-file from H&R Block that we <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/complaints/consumers-speak-hr-blocks-free-offer-only-595-152557.php">reported</a> on Feb 3.</p>
<p>Jon followed the free efile link from <a href="http://www.irs.gov/app/freeFile/jsp/index.jsp">here</a> on irs.gov to <a href="http://www.hrblock.com/taxes/partner/index.jsp?otpPartnerId=180">this</a> H&R Block page. Notice the word 'free' appearing four times. </p>
<p>After following the instructions, Jon was charged $19.95. </p>
<p>He connected to an ineffectual H&R chat bot who tried to blur the issue. Jon wasn't having any of that and forced a secret number out of them: call 1-888-4TAXCUT to get the discount code necessary to complete the free efile, a discount code that is not disclosed anywhere else.</p>
<p>The aforementioned coffee klatch, after the jump.</p>

<p><i>Raziel C: Hello Jon, welcome to H & R Block's Live Technical Support Chat! How can we assist you today?</i><br />
Jon: hi<br />
Jon: i clicked the start now button from this page<br />
Jon: http://www.hrblock.com/taxes/partner/index.jsp?otpPartnerId=180<br />
Jon: and i am under 50 and have an AGI of less than 50k<br />
Jon: but i am still being charged for a federal return<br />
Jon: can you please fix that?<br />
Jon: thanks.<br />
<i>Raziel C: Let me help you with that.</i><br />
Jon: thanks.<br />
Jon: please don't send me any canned answers.<br />
<i>Raziel C: May I ask if you already e-filed your return?</i><br />
Jon: i want to talk to a human being, not an FAQ.<br />
Jon: not yet<br />
Jon: i don't want to be charged $19.99 for it<br />
<i>Raziel C: Okay. One moment please.</i><br />
Jon: thanks<br />
<i>Raziel C: Thank you for waiting.</i><br />
Jon: no problem.<br />
<i>Raziel C: Jon, since you haven't e-file your return and for you to file your return using the Free File option, please create an account by going to http://www.hrblock.com/goto/ffa. Select TaxCut Online Premium to do your federal return for free. If you select to receive your refund via the H&R Block Refund Visa<br />
 Prepaid Card, you will also get your state return for free.</i></p>
<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing H&R Block.<br />
Jon: right<br />
Jon: that's what i did.<br />
Jon: so, please help. thanks.<br />
Jon: also<br />
Jon: i don't *have* to go to the URL you provided<br />
Jon: the URL i provided to you is enough.<br />
Jon: http://www.hrblock.com/taxes/partner/index.jsp?otpPartnerId=180<br />
Jon: or rather, also works.<br />
Jon: in theory.<br />
<i>Raziel C: Jon, you need to create new account on the site http://www.hrblock.com/goto/ffa for you to e-file for free.</i><br />
Jon: NO I DON'T<br />
Jon: READ THE URL THAT I AM PROVIDING YOU<br />
Jon: Here-<br />
Jon: http://www.hrblock.com/taxes/partner/index.jsp?otpPartnerId=180<br />
Jon: I DON'T NEED TO CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT.<br />
Jon: READ THE PAGE.<br />
Jon: PLEASE HELP!!!!<br />
Jon: Hello?<br />
<i>Raziel C: Jon, you created your account to the partners site only not to the FFA site. Partners site only offers discount not the free e-file.</i><br />
Jon: that's not correct<br />
Jon: the partners site says<br />
Jon: FREE TAXCUT Online Premium<br />
Jon: hello?<br />
Jon: in fact, the promotion uses Free four times in the text.<br />
Jon: 1. "Qualified Taxpayers: File your taxes today for FREE"<br />
Jon: 2. "FREE Taxcut Online Premium"<br />
Jon: 3. "START NOW FOR FREE"<br />
Jon: 4. "Start today and do your federal taxes for free!"<br />
Jon: hello?<br />
Jon: are you still there?<br />
<i>Raziel C: Yes. I apologize for the inconvenience, Jon.</i><br />
Jon: unfortunately, i don't need an apology, raziel. i need the problem to be fixed.<br />
<i>Raziel C: Inasmuch as I want to help you with that, the problem is beyond my scope of support. Please call 1-888-4TAXCUT regarding your concern. Thank you.</i><br />
Jon: thanks.<br />
<i>Raziel C: You're welcome!<br />
Raziel C: Is there anything else we can assist you with today?</i><br />
Jon: no.<br />
Jon: thanks for your help.</p>
