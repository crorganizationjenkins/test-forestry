<p>Airlines are maneuvering to make comparison shopping harder by allowing surcharges to be advertised seperately from the fare.</p>
<p>This would make it okay for an airline to promote a $10 fare from New York to Chicago in a direct mailer, only to have buried in fine print on its website a $700 "Daddy Needs a New Pair of Blue Suede Shoes" tax.</p>
<p>The gambit attempts to push online services like Expedia and Orbitz into the lockers by making it harder to piece together all the information, as well as give a wet willy to the average consumer weighing options.</p>
<p>Airline lobbyists forget that resistance is futile. Like Borg, online ticketing services will assimilate and adapt to any fare hijinx. </p>
<p>Trans-continental bullet trains, anyone?</p>
