<p>The gauntlet has been thrown, our thrifty friends. Jeff Jarvis <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2005/12/19/too-good-to-be-true/">writes</a>:<br />

<p><i>Update: Upon initial review, it seems like a pretty basic refinancing deal. LowerMyLease pays the lease buy-out, the refinances a new (now, 'used car') lease with a different lender, presumably taking advantage of the savings allowed by a buyout of the initial lease. Since the company that holds you lease actually owns the car, ACS buys the car outright, getting a discount from the original lease holder. They then make their money by charging you a payment and holding the title of the car itself. We were able to confirm this with ACS.</i></p>
<p>They only refinance newer leases, because the pay-off from the original lease holder is much more advantageous to them. There may be limitations to end-of-lease options compared to a 'standard' lease, like charging an premium buy-out rate to guarantee they maintain ownership of the vehicle.</p>
<p>So while we can't vouch for the company, obviously, we're leaning toward 'GMAC has a crazy high margin,' since his car was sold by GM directly to GMAC for the lease.</p>
