excerpt: A Republican state senator in Georgia has filed a bill that aims to prohibit
  cell phone service providers from forcing customers to restart their contracts just
  to move to a new rate plan. The pandering doublespeak from the cellular service
  providers in this article is sickening.Kristin Wallace, spokeswoman for Sprint Nextel.
  "In principle, Sprint Nextel believes the competitive wireless marketplace is serving
  its consumers well and that regulation of wireless service would be harmful to innovation
  and costly for consumers."Caran Smith, a spokeswoman for Verizon Wireless, said
  ... "By limiting a carrier's contract options, the state in effect is limiting a
  consumer's flexibility to move to rate plans and take advantage of services that
  meet their wireless needs."We understand that to subsidize the cost of phones your
  carrier wants to lock you into a contractâ€”really, we get it. But there's no way
  to justify the inability to switch plans to suit your needs within your contract
  period. (Not to mention the inability to purchase your own phone independent of
  the carrier subsidy and use their service on a month-to-month basis without using
  pre-paid.) (Thanks, Erendira!)
