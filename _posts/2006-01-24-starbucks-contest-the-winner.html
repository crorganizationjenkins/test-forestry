excerpt: First, Congratulations to Gregg Schultz, whose 'Clash of the Titans' story
  has been overwhelmingly selected by readers as the winner of the Starbucks contest.
  He'll be getting a $500 gift certificate to Starbucks, with which he will be able
  to purchase as many large coffees as he desired. As as a commentor noted, his story
  of triumph is certain to be optioned into an uplifting Hollywood movie at nearly
  at time. (We'll expect to be your date to the Golden Globes, Gregg.)

He'll be getting a $500 gift certificate to Starbucks, with which he will be able to purchase as many <i>large</i> coffees as he desired.

<p>And since there's not that much to add to that, we'll ask you a totally unrelated question this morning: What's the easiest experience you've had signing up for a secured credit card? We need to get one and have had awful luck getting banks to actually take our money. Amazing, we know, but that is the way of American business.</p>
