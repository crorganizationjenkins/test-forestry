excerpt: It would appear that losing an arm to an animatronic bear is now the second-leading
  injury at Chuck E. Cheese. These plastic siren whistles have been recalled as a
  choking hazard, with reports that at least three children "swallow[ed] pieces of
  the plastic siren whistle," setting the stage for the most festive asphyxiation
  ever.
