<p>What's healthier? Eating a "heart smart" chocolate bar <a href="http://www.cocoavia.com/science/science.asp">packed with antioxidant flavanols</a> or not eating a chocolate bar at all? Mars, maker of M&Ms and Snickers, is promoting their new 'healthy' branding experiment <a href="http://cocoavia.com">CocoaVia</a>, suggesting that the consumption of <i>two</i> portions of the dark, hippie chocolate will help to reduce bad cholesterol.</p>
<p>This would be great, were it not for the fact that it's <i>still a chocolate bar</i>, something many afflicted by high cholesterol do not need any more than they need self-tanning Cheetos. Especially when the magic chemicals this chocolate contains are "<a href="http://www.cocoavia.com/products/chocbar_info_original.asp">similar to those flavanols found in red wine and green tea.</a>" Yes, the same calorie-free green tea you can purchase for about three dollars per box of 100 at any corner store.</p>
<p>The Consumerist loves chocolate, for we are all too human. But just like we don't pretend to be preventing Alzheimer's when we slam back a six-pack of caffeine-laden Coca-Cola, we don't see a need to make crass dark chocolate bars by pretending that eating them twice a day is anything more than a basic, gluttonous right.</p>
