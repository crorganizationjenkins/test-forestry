<p>&bull; Buy.com has a <a href="http://www.buy.com/retail/clearance/todays_deals.asp?loc=14982&adid=17662">clearance sale</a> running through the 14th. We didn't find any particularly fantastic deals, however, so shop carefully.</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon is running their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/102-0392434-9450502?node=1040668">Winter Clearance Event</a> on shoes and apparel. It's heavy on ugly suede tragedies, as per usual, but there are a few nice deals depending on your taste. [via <a href="http://techbargains.com">Tech Bargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a> is a winner: a refurbished iRobot Roomba Discovery for just $125, shipped. We generally have excellent luck with refurb products, and at that price the little house fraubot is nearly half-off.</p>
