excerpt: Score one for the FTC—and by proxy, consumers—for their statement in the
  Netflix class action settlement, which as originally proposed offered a one-month
  upgrade to customers affected. (So if you were on a three-a-month plan, you'd get
  a four-a-month plan for a single month.) A one-month upgrade that would automatically
  transition into the higher movies-per-month plan after the free period. Ars Technica
  reports this quote from the FTC:In the instant case, the Commission believes that
  the negative option aspect of the proposed settlement appears dangerously close
  to being a promotional gimmick. Specifically, the value of the benefit offered each
  class member is very low, both because those members who accept the benefit receive
  very little of value and because it is reasonably foreseeable that many class members
  will forgo any benefit altogether to avoid the negative option.
