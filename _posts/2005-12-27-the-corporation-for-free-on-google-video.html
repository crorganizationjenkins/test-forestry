excerpt: We haven't yet watched the documentary 'The Corporation, although it's sitting
  in our Netflix queue right below The Odd Couple. So while we'd love to make a comment
  about watching the movie for free being some sort of ironic comeuppance for the
  companies they're railing against, we don't actually know if The Corporation is
  critical of corporations at all. It could be that the movie praises the intellectual
  property and copyright laws to which many of our largest companies are tethered,
  which would make it a little bit sad that someone has uploaded the whole three-hour
  thing to Google Video, where you can watch it for free.

<p>We haven't yet watched the documentary '<a href="http://www.thecorporation.com/">The Corporation</a>, although it's sitting in our Netflix queue right below <i>The Odd Couple</i>. So while we'd love to make a comment about watching the movie for free being some sort of ironic comeuppance for the companies they're railing against, we don't actually know if <i>The Corporation</i> is critical of corporations at all. It could be that the movie praises the intellectual property and copyright laws to which many of our largest companies are tethered, which would make it a little bit sad that someone has uploaded the whole three-hour thing to Google Video, where you can <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=192012118972057552&q=chomsky">watch it for free</a>.</p>
<p>Judging by the screen caps, it would appear the movie is about pickling babies, which is surprisingly rad.</p>
