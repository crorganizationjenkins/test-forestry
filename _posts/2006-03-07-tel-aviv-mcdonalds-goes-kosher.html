<p>Ronald McDonald is gluing on a yarmulke with beef tallow stringing french-fry flavored tahfilen out his pockets.</p>
<p>Under pressure from Tel Aviv's number one rabbi, Israel Meir Lau, two Micky D's branches will boast golden arches with blue backgrounds and display the word, "kosher."</p>
<p>"Blue is the sky, blue is the flag of Israel and blue is not red," Lau told Reuters. "There must be a clear and sharp difference."</p>
<p>"Michael Kramer, a religious diner relishing a burger at one of the two Tel Aviv branches, welcomed the changes. "I can see from far away whether it is a kosher one," he said.</p>
<p>Roi Gerstein was unmoved. "I do not like this change because I am used to the red sign," he said, adding that kosher burgers without cheese were 'just not tasty', " reported Reuters. </p>
