<p>Brendan I. Koerner, a filthy, treacherous rogue if ever one set lies to paper, disembowels a staple of the publishing world's holiday half-assing it: <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2132352/">Holiday Gift Guides</a>. It's an idea very similar in execution to our stunning, fully-assed efforts here at The Consumerist in our "<a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/catalogs/">The Bathroom Scale</a>" series&mdash;eerily similar.</p>
<p>You'd think this sort of piece would have been published earlier, so as to be more use to those buying magazines for gift ideas. It's almost like Mr. Koerner <i>just got the idea</i>.</p>
<p>We'll be expecting something nice this year, Mr. Koerner. Perhaps a bottle of expensive Scotch, as recommended by New York magazine.</p>
<p><i>* We don't actually think Slate ripped us off. But we would like the Scotch.</i></p>
