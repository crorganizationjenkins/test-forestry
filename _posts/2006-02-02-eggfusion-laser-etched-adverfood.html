excerpt: A company named, somewhat predictably, 'EggFusion,' is promoting a technique
  to etch fresh eggs with text with a method that they hope will see adoption from
  both food suppliers and advertisers. EggFusion uses a laser to burn a layer of text
  in the egg shell itself, providing a light grey text on white eggs and lightened
  text on brown eggs. The laser penetrates about 5% of the shell surface, leaving
  the contents inside unharmed.
