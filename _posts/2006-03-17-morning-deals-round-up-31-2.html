excerpt: "â€¢ Today's Woot! is the iRiver PMC-120, one of those 20GB Personal Media
  Center jobbies that Microsoft was shilling a little over a year ago. We say skip
  it, even at $205. Not only is it sort of huge compared to an iPod video or Creative
  Vision M, but the platform does all sorts of stupid things like forcing you to convert
  all your videos before copying them to the device."

<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a> is the iRiver PMC-120, one of those 20GB Personal Media Center jobbies that Microsoft was shilling a little over a year ago. We say skip it, even at $205. Not only is it sort of huge compared to an iPod video or Creative Vision M, but the platform does all sorts of stupid things like forcing you to convert all your videos before copying them to the device.</p>
<p>&bull; So we're not entirely sure that the price of $23 for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009GXZU2/ref=nosim/002-2776641-2416065?n=3375251">PicPack Picnic Backpack</a> is a fantastic deal or anything, but we're pretty impressed by the product. Even if you don't expect to do a lot of picnicking in the near future, it's an easy way to get one's self a cheap set of starter plateware.

<p>&bull; Don't forget Amazon's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/548166/002-2776641-2416065">Friday Sale</a>, with deals like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000536QZ/ref=br_lf_outlet_4/002-2776641-2416065?n=548166&s=outlet&v=glance">Astroglide Silken Secret Vaginal Moisturizer, Pre-Filled Applicators (6)</a> for just $6 and one of the best games of the year, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000BC38K6/qid=/br=1-5/ref=br_lf_outlet_5//002-2776641-2416065?v=glance&s=outlet&n=548166">Civilization IV</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; That Dell Inspiron E1505 Core Duo laptop is has another sale and it's even a better deal today, with a coupon that allows a discount on an upgrade of your choice. It's a little confusing, so we'll leave it to <a href="http://dealnews.com/deals/Dell-Inspiron-E1505-Core-Duo-1-66-GHz-15-Widescreen-Notebook-for-699-shipped-padding/113219.html">Dealnews</a> to explain how to keep the price under $700.</p>
