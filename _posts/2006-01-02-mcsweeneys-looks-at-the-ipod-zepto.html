<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/ipodzepto.jpg"></a>This is a tad old, but if you're upset about not being able to find that coveted <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/shopping/more-consumerist-news-from-around-the-gawkesphere-145912.php">4GB iPod Nano??</a> for Christmas, <a href="http://mcsweeneys.net/2005/11/28fitch.html">this prophetic look at the upcoming iPod Zepto</a> (<em>pictured: left</em>) may put your consumerist fury in perspective.</p>
<p>From the fine lads over at McSweeney's, who ought to be beaten into pulsating goo with a towel filled with oranges for denying visitors to their fine site an RSS feed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Q: The iPod Zepto box was empty.</p>
<p>A: It's not empty. Look closely at the period-sized dot in the middle of the box. Now, find the red rectangular square in the center of the dot. This is the outer packaging of your iPod Zepto. In a sterile, wind-free environment, carefully open the outer packaging and remove the clear-plastic inner wrapping. Finally, using the enclosed high-magnification lens, unwrap the plastic and look for a white case. Inside the white case is your iPod Zepto.</p>
<p>Q: My iPod Zepto stopped playing and now it keeps eating flakes of dead skin that have settled on my furniture.</p>
<p>A: That's a dust mite. Unplug the headphones from wherever you've inserted them in the mite and try to locate your iPod Zepto.</p>
