excerpt: Keep those consumer complaints rolling in, folks. We read each one, trying

<p>Keep those consumer complaints rolling in, folks. We read each one, trying to determine if you've got a real beef (and you almost always do), and do our best to get the word out.</p>
<p>By the same token, if you've got a good gripe about someone we're posting, post a comment about their shortcoming. And if you don't have a comments login, all you have to do is ask. We can't promise we'll hand one out&mdash;you'll have to <i>want</i> it&mdash;but we're not nearly as stingy about them as some.</p>
<p>Like those catty bitches at Gawker, we're saying.</p>
