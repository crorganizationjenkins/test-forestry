<p>A brief glance on what goes on inside the mind of PR giant and Wal-Mart lover, Richard Edelman, courtesy of Gawker.com. Our virginal, Harriet-the-Spy-esque sister <a href="http://www.gawker.com/news/publicists/nyo-flacks-win-awards-dis-reporters-discuss-celebs-shit-159160.php">writes</a>,</p>
<p>"Observer political reporter Jason Horowitz...covered last week<br />
s PR Week public-relations awards at Tavern on the Green...<a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45&aid=98021">Most will tell you</a> this is the best bit in his piece:</p>
<p>
It used to be I would schmooze you and I was your flack,<br />
 said [Edelman PR chief Richard, pictured] Edelman, whose firm netted about $260 million in 2005.<br />
Today, if we want to get a message into the public<br />
s conversation, we just make a post on a blog. If The Wall Street Journal goes after a client, we don<br />
t have to accept that anymore. Let<br />
s post the documents we gave The Journal; let<br />
s show the interviews the newspaper decided not to show.</p>
<p>
You<br />
re not God anymore,<br />
 he said.</p>
<p>But it<br />
s not. This is:</p>
<p>
It<br />
s always exciting to be considered amid the best campaigns in the business,<br />
 said Mr. Stroup, who campaigned with Cybill Shepherd to help raise awareness about irritable-bowel syndrome.<br />
We are proud of what we achieved as an agency. When Cybill was doing Moonlighting, she was doubling over in pain.</p>
<p>So now we know glamorous Maddie Hayes had constant cramps and diarrhea? Great PR, that."</p>

<p>We're going to pose the following question to Marshall Manson in our ongoing investigation into the open and transparent world of big box retailer blogging: Does Wal-Mart, likewise, get cramps and diarrhea? And if you house Wal-Mart, K-Mart and Target together in a dormitory for a few months, do their cycles of bleeding the consumer start to sync up?</p>
