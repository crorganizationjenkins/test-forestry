excerpt: What do Hallmark and H&R Block have in common? They both are based in Kansas
  City, Missouri, and they both create holidays to celebrate an occasion for you to
  give them more money. H&R Block has created National Tax Advice Day to ostensibly
  help you learn such ethical tips as how to claim your iPod as tax deductible. (We
  aren't joking.)

<p>What do Hallmark and H&R Block have in common? They both are based in Kansas City, Missouri, and they both create holidays to celebrate an occasion for you to give them more money. H&R Block has created <a href="http://nationaltaxadviceday.com/">National Tax Advice Day</a> to ostensibly help you learn such ethical tips as how to claim your iPod as tax deductible. (We aren't joking.)</p>
<p>We like the idea in spirit&mdash;who doesn't like learning how to screw the government?&mdash;but we give you fair, obvious warning: The longer you listen to H&R Block's free advice, the more likely it is you'll find your taxes done by a middle-aged house wife making so side money to buy her kids a new (tax-deductible) iPod.</p>
