<p>Jetblue wants to increase ticket prices around $10 per ticket. </p>
<p>The busy route between New York and Florida is the planned testing ground.</p>
<p>That's like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three fewer Boca Raton poolside daiquiris.
</li>
<li>A down payment on a New York taxi ride
</li>
<li>A really good price in the airport restroom.</li>
</ul>
