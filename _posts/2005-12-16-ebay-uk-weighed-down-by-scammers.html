excerpt: eBay UK is getting fraudier, reports the BBC. Crooks aren't using just the
  standard, in-system scam, either—selling something they don't have—but are instead
  hijacking high-scoring accounts, so better to lure in those who really want to buy
  a used hot tub.Adidas told the BBC that it monitored up to 12,000 auctions involving
  its goods every day on the British site - yet it estimated that up to 40% of all
  Adidas products available were counterfeit.It's an online auction site—there are
  going to be some scams. Forty percent, however, is somewhat amazing. And if we can't
  trust customer ratings, then what does eBay offer that Craigslist does not?
