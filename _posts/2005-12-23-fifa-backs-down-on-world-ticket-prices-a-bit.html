excerpt: 'For you in this time of joy, a happyish ending to Grant Williams''s FIFA
  World Cup Ticket Saga:Edit: I get results, baby! According to the Babelfish translation
  of this page, the TST-Series non-refundable fees have been negotiated down to only
  10, 20, and 30 euros per ticket instead of the 20, 30, and 50 euros they were originally.
  Not perfectly to my satisfaction, but better than nothing, I suppose.'
