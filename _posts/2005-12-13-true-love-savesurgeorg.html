excerpt: We're not really in a position to mock people slavishly devoted to unhealthy
  obsessions with consumer brands. (It took us three Star Wars prequels to finally
  turn our anger to hatred.) But we have to admit to cocking our middle knuckle up
  in the traditional nougie-giving position before we realized that soda pop fans
  at SaveSurge.org were our people.And the citrus flavor was just AWESOME... I fell
  in love. I used every chance I got to buy it. My school had a vending machine that
  contained SURGE... I ended up spending the majority of my lunch money buying SURGE
  from that machine. I talked my mom into supporting my SURGE habit by buying two
  liters of the wonderful citrus soda for me to enjoy once I got home. It was rare
  that someone saw me without a two liter or can of SURGE grasped snugly in my hand.Bear
  in mind, this isn't regular astroturfing (we think), because Surge doesn't exist
  anymore.

<p>The Mountain Dew knock-off from The Coca-Cola company was discontinued in 2002, but fans have huddled together&mdash;much like we will after The Reckoning, our bodies fueled by the sugary syrup that will ooze from their eye deposits.</p>
