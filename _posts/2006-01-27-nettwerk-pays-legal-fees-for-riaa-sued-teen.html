<p>Man, the Canadians are just the superstars of taking on the RIAA. First, <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/sony/now-canada-is-suing-sony-over-rootkits-147083.php">they sued the pants off of Sony BMG for the root-kit fiasco.</a> And now, <a href="http://www.nettwerk.com">Nettwerk</a>, a Canadian music label representing artists like Avril Lavigne, Barenaked Ladies,  Dido, Sarah McLachlan and a lot of other hot Canadian girls are paying the legal fees of one of those typical kids who's being sued by the RIAA for downloading a song off of Kazaa:</p>
<blockquote><p>Teenager Elisa Greubel recently contacted Nettwerk client MC Lars, whose new track "Download This Song" tackles the file-sharing issue, on his Web site, writing, "My family is one of many seemingly randomly chosen families to be sued by the RIAA. No fun. You can't fight them, trying could possibly cost us millions. The line 'they sue little kids downloading hit songs,' basically sums a lot of the whole thing up. I'm not saying it is right to download but the whole lawsuit business is a tad bit outrageous."</p>
<p>In response, Nettwerk has agreed to pay all legal fees for the Greubel's family, which is challenging the RIAA's suit. Chicago lawyer Charles Lee Mudd Jr. will represent the Greubels. Mudd has represented multiple individuals who have been sued by the RIAA since 2003.</p>
<p>"Litigation is not 'artist development.' Litigation is a deterrent to creativity and passion and it is hurting the business I love," added McBride. "The current actions of the RIAA are not in my artists' best interests."</p>
