excerpt: "â€¢ Woot's hawking that 61-inch Infocus DLP HDTV again for $2,500 (and only
  $5 shipping!) Is it a good deal? It's certainly not bad, and has what we consider
  the minimum in HDTV resolution, 1,280 x 720. But HDTVs aren't doing anything but
  falling in price these days, so waiting may net you something more to your liking."
