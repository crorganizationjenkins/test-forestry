<p>&bull; Doing last minute shopping for the anal retentive is fun&mdash;just waiting until the last minute will irk them. Encourage them to document the ways they hate you with a new Palm PDA and get <a href="http://store.palm.com/home/index.jsp">free overnight shipping</a>. Those new $100 Z22 color PDAs are pretty swell.</p>
<p>&bull; To get the hundred dollar price on this <a href="http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=10412724&adid=17662">I/O Magic Gigibank 6GB storage thingy</a>, you'll have to send in a $30 mail-in rebate. That said, $130 for a 6GB pocket-sized storage device isn't awful. [via <a href="http://techbargains.com">TechBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon has a bunch of Timberland jackets on sale, plus an additional $20 off $75 coupon. Some, like the canvas jacket, are just $40. Not bad. <a href="http://www.bensbargains.net/ktalk/1135168161,30663,.shtml">Ben's Bargains</a> has the details.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.woot.com/">Woot</a> of the day: Gyration Ultra GT Full-Size Keyboard and Mouse for $55, shipped. The mouse uses a gyroscope to allow use without a surface, so you can get all Harry Potter when you're watching movies on your home theater PC.</p>
<p>&bull; And since we're entering convention season, The Consumerist had need for a new Powerbook battery. Batteries.com was not only cheaper for a generic replacement unit, but the current code <b>HOLIDAY</b> was good for an additional 15%, plus free shipping. We are pleased.</p>
