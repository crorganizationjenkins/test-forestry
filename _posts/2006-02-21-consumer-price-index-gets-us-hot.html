<p>It may be hard to sleep tonight, tomorrow the Feds release the Consumer Price Index (C.P.I.) at 8:30 am EST. We'll post the results on The Consumerist but you can also hit refresh over <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cpi/">here</a>. </p>
<p>Pictured is Secretary of Labor, Elaine L. Chao, who is likewise reportedly, "totally stoked to be dropping mad economic science on the streets." </p>
<p>Bloomberg estimates a .5% increase in the C.P.I., which measures urban price changes in a core "basket" of goods: Housing 42%; Food 18%; Transportation 17%; Medical Care 6%; Apparel 6%; Entertainment 4%; Other 7%. </p>
<p>Here's hoping your wages got at least .5% increase this year, too. Salut, oh C.P.I, you indefatigable bastard.</p>
