  many unsuspecting users' systems — causing it to suddenly activate and destroy all
  of their Microsoft Office files — Microsoft has let everyone know that they won't

Despite the fact that tomorrow is D-Day for the computer worm lurking in many unsuspecting users' systems &mdash; causing it to suddenly activate and destroy all of their Microsoft Office files &mdash; Microsoft has let everyone know that they won't be releasing a fix for the Kama Sutra worm until &mdash; appropriately enough &mdash; Valentine's Day.</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=DKSDTPBSRN2R0QSNDBCCKHSCJUMEKJVN?articleID=177105799">Information Week has the scoop: </a></p>
<blockquote><p> Microsoft Monday posted a security advisory on the Kama Sutra/Blackworm/MyWife worm that's set to overwrite Office documents on infected PCs Friday, but the company has decided against updating its Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool before the next regularly-scheduled release of Feb. 14.</p>
<p>The security advisory -- a mechanism Microsoft uses to both alert users of impending threats and give them advice or workarounds to apply -- repeats recommendations that most security vendors have been offering since the worm debuted two weeks ago.</p>
<p>It also notes that infected PCs will be in danger on Friday, Feb. 3, when the worm will overwrite several popular file formats, including those of Microsoft Office, with useless data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the fact that this worm targets an exploit in Microsoft's own operating system to destroy the data of Microsoft's own Office software suite on a known and specific date, it is just utterly absurd that Bill Gates' techs in Silicon Valley wouldn't prioritize this. Hope everyone who is unknowingly infected with Kama Sutra has their PC hooked up to a flux capacitor. Then, applying Microsoft's February 14th fix for a February 3rd exploit can be done by the simple expedient of pushing your clock speed up to 88mhz per second.</p>
