excerpt: Yesterday - in our Cool, Innovative Advertising? post - we wrote about advertisers
  that "got it", who managed to briefly make the world a cooler, more surreal place
  for their intended audience/suckers. Of course, sometimes that daily dose of surreality
  isn't the masterstroke of some hip marketing guru, but the result of butterfingers
  with a bolt gun. The lads over at Billboardom have a great story about an ad campaign
  in Toronto in which a luger, frozen counter-gravitationally in time, uses a Mini
  Cooper to luge down a building. Except the Mini went plummeting off the side of
  the building, cratered, then erupted into what one can only hope was a fiery explosion
  10 stories down. Absolutely awesome. Thankfully, no one was hit by the car on the
  way down, which is good news from a humanitarian perspective but leaves us twitching
  at our computer with a line about the impact of advertising on the average consumer
  that now, alas, can never be used.
