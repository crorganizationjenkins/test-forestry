<p>&bull; Sportswear retailer Altrec.com has an '<a href="http://www.altrec.com/outdoors/outlet/?AID=5469810&PID=227502&cjgate=1">Extreme Savings</a>' event, where you can wail the most wicked gnarly discounts from 30 to 60% off regular prices. Brands include The North Face, Burton, and Patagonia.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.ebags.com/index.cfm?sourceid=FTG::00000000003506943100&bfencoded=qIZ6Q-HULwrtAhcd91J@">eBags</a> has a 20% off sale, although they also say their winter sale is up to 60% off, so we're sort of confused. The 20% off code is applied automatically during browsing, however, so we'll stuck with that. [via <a href="http://techbargains.com">TechBargains</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; And to continue our inadvertent hiking and traveling theme for today, Backcountry.com has a <a href="http://www.backcountryoutlet.com/outlet/index.html?CP=Affiliate&CMP=AFC-Affiliate&ATT=Banner&GCID=C14965x002-Banner&AID=10372184&PID=552179">70% off sale</a> in their outlet, with brands including Oakley, Dakine, and Black DIamond. Free shipping over $50.</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon has this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PKU9C/102-0392434-9450502?n=172282">Dual-brand XDM-6820 200-Watt In-Dash CD Player</a> for $85 that not only decodes MP3s burned onto CDs, but has that all-too-uncommon line-in for your iPod or other MP3 player. Not a bad deal for a cheap upgrade for your car's stereo.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://dealnews.com/jobs.html">DealNews is hiring a part-timer</a>. Could be a fun way to make a little scratch (and then blow it when you find all the good deals first). If you get the job you have to give us a heads-up on the really sweet deals.</p>
