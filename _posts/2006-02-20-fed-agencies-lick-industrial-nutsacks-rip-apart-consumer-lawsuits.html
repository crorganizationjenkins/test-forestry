---
<p>Softly but surely, Bush<br />
s lap dog federal agencies help industries gain shielding from consumer and state lawsuits. Among the erosions:</p>
<p>
  The Currency Comptroller routinely goes double-dildo with national banks to undermine state<br />
s consumer protection laws. </p>
<p>
  The FDA lip-synced a legal opinion last month proclaiming that FDA approved labels should give pill companies carte blanche from most suiture.</p>
<p>
  The Justice Department helped industry groups kill a pollution-control rule in Southern California requiring cleaner-running buses, garbage trucks and other fleet vehicles.<br />
It<br />
s a trash wagon, it<br />
s supposed to be dirty,<br />
 said the lobbyists before diving into a pool of gold coins.<br />
And buses are for poor people. Who wants to remind them they can<br />
t afford a shower?</p>
<p>
Greve, an American Enterprise Institute scholar...said well-connected industry law firms were part of a policy network providing legal and political rationale for the effort.</p>
<p>He called them "a merry band of Washington lawyers<br />
 who know how to push the buttons" and "get things done."</p>
