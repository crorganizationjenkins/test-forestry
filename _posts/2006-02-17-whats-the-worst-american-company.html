<p>We<br />
ll round up the qualifiers, make a nice chunky tournament ladder, and let the companies face-off in a dance-to-the-death.</p>
<p>Use any criteria you wish&mdash;but be sure to tell us <i>why</i> they are the worst.</p>
<p>Oh yes, we<br />
ll drop plenty of kung-fu movie quotes in the mix.</p>
<p>
My style is the best!<br />
