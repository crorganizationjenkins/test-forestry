  is the IM exchange I just had with H&R Block after attempting to use the "free"
  1040 return service they pitched to me via e-mail.  I own to some early crankiness
  but keep in mind their "fast" online response had kept me waiting a lot longer than
  it would have taken to do my taxes the old fashioned way:'

<p>You have been connected to Leonardo G.</p>
<p>DANIEL F: Why are you trying to charge me $5.95 when the words "FREE PREPARATION AND RETURN" have been plastered over every link I've followed to get here? Here is what you sent me in your email: "Come back to TaxCut and get FREE federal tax prep with eFile, no qualifications - just use the links in this email!" Then, once I get through the whole process, it tells me I have "selected" to pay $5.95. Why? I never "selected" that. This is dishonest.</p>
<p>Leonardo G: Hello DANIEL, welcome to H & R Block's Live Technical Support Chat! How can we assist you today?</p>
<p>DANIEL F: See above.</p>
<p>DANIEL F: The word FREE literally appears ten times in your email</p>
<p>Leonardo G: Yes Daniel, and I am currently reviewing it, one moment please?</p>
<p>Leonardo G: Have you been charged already Daniel?</p>
<p>DANIEL F: Nope, I stopped when it asked me how I "wanted" to pay</p>
<p>Leonardo G: Sorry to keep you waiting Daniel.</p>
<p>Leonardo G: I am currently processing the information so please bear with me.</p>
<p>Leonardo G: Daniel did you create a new account with the link that was provided to you?</p>
<p>DANIEL F: No I used the one I used last year</p>
<p>DANIEL F: That's why you had my email address in the first place</p>
<p>Leonardo G: Thank you for that information.</p>
<p>Leonardo G: Sorry for the confusion, please be informed that in order to avail the promotional program, you have to create a new account with the link that was provided to you.</p>
<p>DANIEL F: OK, Leonardo, why would it send me a promotional offer to an EXISTING ACCOUNT, with my user name highlighted, to get me to sign up for a NEW account? That makes no sense at all. Nowhere does it say that I have to sign up for a new account</p>
<p>DANIEL F: It says, "just use the links in this email" which I did, where it led me to sign into my already existing account.</p>
<p>Leonardo G: I am referring to the link that was sent to you by e-mail Daniel.</p>
<p>DANIEL F: Right, and I am telling you that the promotional offer in the email referred to my existing account. Why else would it say, "Get started now" with a link to my account sign-in?</p>
<p>Leonardo G: Okay I am checking the matter right now, one moment please?</p>
<p>DANIEL F: Sure.</p>
<p>Leonardo G: Thank you for patiently waiting Daniel.</p>
<p>Leonardo G: If you wouldn't mind Daniel, may I ask for the link that was e-mailed to you? Or if it is possible for you to have that e-mailed posted here?</p>
<p>DANIEL F: The email referred to this link: http://www.hrblock.com/taxes/blahblahblah</p>
<p>Leonardo G: Thank you for that Daniel. I will be looking for the link right now to check about the matter, one moment please?</p>
<p>Leonardo G: Thank you for all the information Daniel.</p>
<p>Leonardo G: Well Daniel the reason why your username is indicated within the e-mail that you received is for verification purposes only.</p>
<p>DANIEL F: Why would it tell me to "login to get started today" instead of telling me to create a new account, Leonardo?</p>
<p>DANIEL F: Why would H&R Block send a promotional offer requiring the setup of a new account to their existing customers?</p>
<p>DANIEL F: Hello?</p>
<p>Leonardo G: Sorry to keep you waiting.</p>
<p>Leonardo G: Inasmuch as I would like to help you with that, I have already exhausted my resources and did not find the correct resolution for that, I do apologize.</p>
