excerpt: 'Just in case you purchased a Sony CD "protected" by the rootkit DRM and
  want to claim your $7.50 worth of mp3s, SonySuit.com has all the available details
  on registering to take part. We''re still particularly interested in the precedent
  being set here by Sony: they have gone on record stating that $7.50 is the price
  of two full albums of digital music. And a few mp3s to have your computer''s security
  compromised still seems like a pretty crappy deal. But it''s better than nothing
  and every person taking part in the class action suit is helping send a message
  to companies trying to implement similarly sleazy DRM schemes. So go check it out,
  if you''ve still got that Celine Dion receipt in your wallet.'
