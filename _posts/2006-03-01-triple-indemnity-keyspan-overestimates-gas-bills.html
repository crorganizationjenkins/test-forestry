<p>Got bi-monthly bill from Keyspan. Gas supplier. Opened. Read. </p>
<p>$800 charge. Read again.</p>
<p>Somewhere, heard someone make noises. Like an animal. Read it one more time. Noticed 'reading ESTIMATED.' </p>
<p>Strange. </p>
<p>Who would estimate therms like that? Several times what they were before? </p>
<p>
Only one thing could. A stupid gas company. It had to be stopped.</p>
<p>Walked downstairs. Read meter. Meter said 288, not 516. Called Keyspan. </p>
<p>Corrected them. </p>
<p>They said they'd send a new bill right over, sir. Hung up phone. Watched sun set. Shivered. Boiler not working either. Coincidence. Maybe. Rage, she is a warm mistress at your side.</p>
