<p>What if we sent in the full remaining balance on all our credit cards? Every single person in America, paid... off... alllllllll their credit card debt. Our Amex's, Discovers, Visas, Mastercards. All of them.</p>
<p>Would the heavens open and rainbow ponies feverishly lick our 16th chakras while massaging our seventh?</p>
