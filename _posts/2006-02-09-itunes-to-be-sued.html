<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/badapple.jpg"></a>Is Apple about to choke on its own feculent, albeit, extremely well designed, fruits? A new threat to iTunes should have C.E.O. Steve Jobs<br />
 dome crackling like a Jacobs Laddder.</p>
<p>A judge in Northern California <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/scripts/printer_friendly.pl?page=/andrews/bt/cmp/20050922/20050922slattery.html">green lighted</a> plaintiff Thomas Slattery<br />
s efforts to pursue a class-action suit against Apple.  At stake is DRM-tunes 80% market share, thanks mainly to its anti-competitive tying of the iTunes store and the iTunes player. </p>
<p>The question is, with Apple<br />
