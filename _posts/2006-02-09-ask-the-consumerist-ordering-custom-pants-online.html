excerpt: But it looks like there are a lot of places online that will do it. I figured
  that before I went off half cocked and ordered a pair sight unseen, that the Consumerist
  (or its readers) might have some insight into which services would be good or worth
  checking out."

<p>Reader Mike writes, <i>"I have a real problem finding pants that fit. The problem is not just that they don<br />
t carry my size-- they don<br />
t even make it. I have a waist size of 30 and I need a 34 length in men<br />
s. Normally I just suffer with pants that are too baggy or too short. Big and tall sizes are way too big. But someone mentioned custom jeans to me. Target sells women<br />
s jeans for 35$ and that sounds like a good value. Sadly they don<br />
t make men<br />
s.</p>

<p>We feel your pain. Although we haven't worn 30-inch waists since we were pre-pubescent&mdash;even then we had a nasty tendency to wear sweatpants. Sweatpants that matched our sweatshirts. With <i>knee patches</i>.</p>
<p>Our suggestions, such as they are, after the jump.</p>
<p>A cursory glance through Google brought up very few options. We're actually surprised you found "lots of places online." You should share those with us!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.landsend.com/cd/index/fp/0,,65203,00.html">Land's End</a> will provide you custom-fitted pants, but only if you're willing to wear one of their two designs&mdash;dress pants or chinos.</p>
<p>Levi's was considering a personalized jeans program, but it appears that custom 501s have been 401'd.</p>
<p>Have you considered making friends with a local tailor? Minor alterations can be as cheap as $20. In your case, you might be able to buy a slightly larger waist size and have them brought in.</p>
<p>We've recently had a very positive experience commissioning custom clothing from crafters on <a href="http://etsy.com">Etsy</a>. While pants are one of the most difficult things to make at home, you might be able to find an especially skilled sew...er? to help you out. Then you'd have not only custom pants, but pants that are unique. (Of course, they will probably be crocheted, but that's not all bad.)</p>
<p>Readers? Help this lithe young man buy some pants!</p>
