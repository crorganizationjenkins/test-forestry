excerpt: We won! Maybe! At least, we'll take the credit! Good ol' Amazon listened
  to our complaints about mixing x-rated hentai when doing searches for hentai and
  has quickly fixed the problem. Performing a search for anime now returns only the
  most wholesome of results, while searching for 'hentai' returns all the tentacles
  and demon incest that we hold so dear.
