<p><a href="http://robsterling.com">Robert Sterling</a> forwarded us this story, entitled <a href="http://timesdispatch.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RTD%2FMGArticle%2FRTD_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1128768581618&path=%21news%21localupdates&s=1045855935074">'Unmarked cemetery found near Wal-Mart'</a>. We offer it to you as a test.</p>
<p>Did you, upon reading the headline, presume that Wal-Mart must have had something to do with the murder and midnight burial of a family of five? How biased you are against the largest retailer in America! They were actually murdered by Kohl's.<br />
<blockquote>The remains are in a muddy cemetery on the future site of Kohl's of Culpeper and next to a Wal-Mart parking lot. Archaeologists say the remains are located within what is known as the Green-Williams family cemetery.</p></blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<p>Houston said unmarked graves within family cemeteries were generally reserved for people of lower social status, like "an impoverished cousin."We're not sure a world where an impoverished cousin is forbidden to lay down his head in Wal-Mart's cool, affordable soil is a world we want to be part of.</p>
