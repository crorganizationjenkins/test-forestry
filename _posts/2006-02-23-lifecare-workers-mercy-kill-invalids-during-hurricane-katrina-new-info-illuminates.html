<p>Secret court documents reviewed by NPR and not yet available to the public reveal further disturbing details about<br />
mercy killings<br />
 during Hurricane Katrina, with specific regard to the seventh floor, leased to the LifeCare hospital management group, of the Memorial Medical Center.</p>
<p>Administrators interviewed,<br />
say they were told that the 'evacuation plan' for the seventh floor was to not leave any living patients behind, and that 'a lethal dose would be administered'.
 </p>
<p>All the patients were classified<br />
DNR,<br />
 short for Do Not Resuscitate.</p>
<p>
A nurse told LifeCare's pharmacy director that the hospital's seventh-floor LifeCare patients were critical and not expected to be evacuated with the rest of the hospital.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, did you say Hippocratic or Hypocritic oath?</p>
<p>Macabre, fattening your bottom line with our loved one's lives. </p>
<p>Makes one want to mercy kill some corporate hospital workers. </p>
<p>Shotgun to the head.</p>
<p>Blam!</p>
<p>Painless.</p>
