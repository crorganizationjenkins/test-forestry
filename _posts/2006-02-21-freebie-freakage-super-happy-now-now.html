<p><a href="http://www.aquafresh.com/registration.promo">Free Sample of Aquafresh</a></p>
<p>The rest of the site is worth poking around if you want Glaxo-Smith Kline's idea of deep house pumping through your speakers. Maybe it's a tie-in to their skunk-works ecstasy production division? You'll also come across <a href="http://www.softcoin.com/p/handler?target=general&action=getSignUp&sid=770">three free downloads</a> for Sony Connect, if you're into that whole legal music thing.</p>
<p>Big Island Coffee Sample. The coffee looks like <a href="http://www.coffeesofaloha.com/100hawcof.html">this</a>.</p>
<p>Just <a href="http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/manage/subscriberprefs.aspx?customerid=4328">sign up</a> for their mailing list and the coffee is yours. Hey, it's from Hawaii so the junk mail is like, exotic. </p>
<p>Get a <a href="http://www.bmw-sauber-f1.com/en/index.html">free BMW Sauber F1 team cap</a> voucher after your hand in your old BMW cap.</p>
<p>Offer not good in USA or Austria. Sorry, Franz Ferdinand descendents, listeners.</p>
