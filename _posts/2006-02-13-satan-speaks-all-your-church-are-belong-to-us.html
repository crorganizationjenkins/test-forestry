<p><a href="http://www.churchmarketingsucks.com/archives/2006/02/letting_satan_s.html">Church Marketing Sucks has a post up</a> detailing the unique tag line a church has chosen for itself in Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>The quote? Luke Chapter 4, Verse 7. </p>
<p>The words? Spilled forth in bile from the forked tongue of the Prince of Darkness. </p>
<p>Note to Christians! Not <em>everything</em> in The Bible is <em>God's</em> inspired word.</p>
<p>Note to everyone who read the title of this post and thought "What is this? KOTAKU?": we are truly, truly sorry. </p>
