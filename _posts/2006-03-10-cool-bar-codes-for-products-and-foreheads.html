excerpt: As all men know, in our dystopian future, bar codes will be tattooed directly
  over our pineal gland for easier government processing. This is supported by a vast
  library of dystopian fiction and comic books. And — as those high school sophomores
  who will so feverishly insist that 1984 is Orwell's line by line premonition of
  the Bush Administration well know — these things always come true. So those of us
  with a flair for fashion should probably start thinking ahead about what statement
  we want our bar codes to make.
