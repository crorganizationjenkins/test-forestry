<blockquote><p>The U.S. and its wealthy allies are moving to approve a first-of-its-kind plan to encourage pharmaceuticals companies to develop vaccines for diseases that afflict countries too poor to afford them.</p>
<p>Finance ministers from the Group of Eight major industrialized powers, who met here this weekend, expect to approve a pilot project when they next get together, in Washington in April.</p>
<p>Under an advance market commitment plan, the G-8 nations would promise to subsidize the purchase of new vaccines -- for between $800 million and $6 billion -- if pharmaceuticals companies develop ones that meet standards of efficacy and safety. Once the G-8 spends the pledged amount, the drug companies would sell the vaccine at a set discount in the developing world.</p>

It's a hard problem, to balance the accountability and innovation of privatized pharmaceutical companies while trying to ensure that they sell their products for a price that will allow the medicine to be used by everyone who actually needs it. We're glad to see the U.S. making a stab at solving it.</p>
