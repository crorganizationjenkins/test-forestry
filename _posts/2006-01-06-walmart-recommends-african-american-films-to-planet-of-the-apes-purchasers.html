excerpt: 'Walmart''s at it again:'

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/06/news/companies/walmart_dvd/index.htm?cnn=yes">Walmart's at it again:</a></p>
<p><em>"The retail giant apologized Thursday after its Web site directed buyers of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and "Planet of the Apes" DVDs to consider DVDs with African American themes.</em></p>
<p>Wal-Mart said in a statement it was "heartsick" over the offensive combinations and that its retail Web site was linking "seemingly random combinations of titles."</p>
<p>The company said it would shut down its cross-selling system until the problem was resolved. It said the system was also referring buyers of movies such as "Home Alone" and "Power Puff Girls" to African American-themed DVDs."</p>
<p>Which we suppose is better than Walmart's recommendation system giving way to its latent offensive inclinations and recommending "Lolita" and other pedophile- themed DVDs to Power Puff Girl and Macaulay Culkin enthusiasts. But not by much.</p>
