excerpt: This is a little New Yorkish, but we're in the process of searching for a
  new apartment in Brooklyn and to stumble along a well-written story about a frightening
  hag of a landlady fills up our spine with cold water like it were an old radiator.
  'Gloria Trembicky is a Bad Landlord' is the chronicle of one couple's awful experience
  with a Park Slope apartment with little heat, occasional droughts of both hot and
  cold water, and a husband/fixit-monkey who was too cheap or stupid to realize that
  reusing bent screws might be a problem.

<p>This is a little New Yorkish, but we're in the process of searching for a new apartment in Brooklyn and to stumble along a well-written story about a frightening hag of a landlady fills up our spine with cold water like it were an old radiator. <a href="http://seriousdanger.com/trembicky/">'Gloria Trembicky is a Bad Landlord'</a> is the chronicle of one couple's awful experience with a Park Slope apartment with little heat, occasional droughts of both hot and cold water, and a husband/fixit-monkey who was too cheap or stupid to realize that reusing bent screws might be a problem.</p>
<p>Even better, it has a link section that includes some helpful places for New Yorkers to search for past violations&mdash;before they move into a new apartment.</p>
<p>But really, besides having a need to share this story before it consumed us, we'd like to hear about your worst rental experiences. Landlords are the worst.</p>
