excerpt: "â€¢ Dell Home is selling the Inspiron E1505 Dual Core Notebook for $699 (and
  you can usually find a $35 off coupon on eBay with little trouble). While it's not
  much of a gaming machine, it's a fine notebook for pretty much anything else at
  a very fair price. Our only suggested upgrade? A faster 7200RPM hard drive. [via

<p>&bull; Dell Home is selling the <a href="http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?c=us&cs=19&l=en&oc=E1505L1&s=dhs">Inspiron E1505 Dual Core Notebook</a> for $699 (and you can usually find a $35 off coupon on eBay with little trouble). While it's not much of a gaming machine, it's a fine notebook for pretty much anything else at a very fair price. Our only suggested upgrade? A faster 7200RPM hard drive.

<p>&bull; CompUSA is running a Midnight Madness sale this Friday, staring at 6PM, of course. You can take a look at the <a href="http://f.chtah.com/i/45/143882431/35660emailblast-screen.pdf">flyer</a>, but the stand out items are a Toshiba laptop for $499 (after rebate; go for the Dell, we say) and a PC with monitor and printer for $200 (again, after rebate). In fact, the more we look at this sale, the more we realize the prices are due to rebates, which we hate. Stay away&mdash;CompUSA smells weird, anyway.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://disneyshopping.go.com/">Disney Shoping</a> has a 17%-off store-wide sale on most items, using the code <b>LUCKY17</b>. [via <a href="http://dealnews.com">DealNews</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; A tipster sends us <a href="http://www.dealsofamerica.com/">Deals of America</a>, a new (?) deals site. Looks decent, but we don't see in the way of unique features.</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a>: The iGo EveryWhere Power 15 Universal Power Adapter for $35, shipped. Radio Shack sells the iGo for $60, and they don't include the iPod adapter that iGo is throwing in today for Wooters. Even better, they're only charging $5 instead of $10 today for additional adapters. We're going to say this is a pretty hot one.</p>
