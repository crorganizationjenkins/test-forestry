<p>If textual bitching doesn't get your rocks off enough, go auditory with the Buzz-o-Phone. Call 1-800-591-5375 and leave a 2-minute-or-under product/ service/ company gripe or praise. Your message gets automatically uploaded to the Buzz-o-Phone podcast for other's delight and perusal. </p>
<p>Why? Because <a href="http://www.thebasement.com/blojsom/blog/thebasement/">some guy</a> in Oklahoma is a hardcore word-of-mouth marketing hobbyist and thought this would be a cool experiment.</p>
<p>You can also crawl the podcast feed to hear other's gripes, like <a href="http://www.buzzophone.com/mp3/20060221-184509-114056903030.mp3">this guy who has a bipolar love/hate affair</a> with Dell computers and possibly the creepiest radio voice, ever.</p>
<p>This lady is just so happy to get Fedex's mishandling of her packages <a href="http://www.buzzophone.com/mp3/20060221-122802-114054640227.mp3">off her chest</a>.</p>
<p>There are also be a good amount of happy product shoutouts, like this guy who's <a href="http://www.buzzophone.com/mp3/20060220-181718-114048095921.mp3">really into some Saka [sp?] Grounds</a> coffee he found on the internet.</p>
<p>And those that sound seeded by people looking to promote a company, as in this <a href="http://www.buzzophone.com/mp3/20060216-072108-11400959889.mp3">lass who's really into</a> threadless.com</p>
<p>Of course then there's the <a href="http://www.buzzophone.com/mp3/20060218-203405-114031636518.mp3">prank caller</a> complaining about KY Jelly giving him gushing warts. Yeesh.</p>
