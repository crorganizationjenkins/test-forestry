(<i>Thanks, Ben!</i>)</p>
<p>&bull; Specialized is selling their <a href="http://www.specialized.com/bc/SBCEqProduct.jsp?spid=11451&minisite=10080&xsrc=3428h">04 Speed Zone 5.0 Elite Bike Computer</a> for just $20, down from $70. Fedex Ground shipping for $5. [via <a href="http://techbargains.com">TechBargains</a>]</p>

<p>&bull; This deal for a Canon SD450 5-megapixel camera takes a little extra skill, but we think it's time you moved to the next level. Buy the camera from <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/ProductDetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&cs=19&sku=A0521528&category_id=6056&brandid=31">Dell Home</a>, receive an automatic 20% off, then buy a <a href="http://search.ebay.com/35-dell-coupon">$35 off $300 coupon from eBay</a> to bring your total price to $244 shipped free. Trouble? A little. Worth it? By over $50 off the going rate. [via <a href="http://slickdeals.net">Slickdeals</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a> is the LG Progressive Scan DVD/Divx Player with HD Upconversion for $65 dollars, shipped. It's a refurb, but that don't scare us none. This one has got all the right features, but sadly we're not up to snuff with the wide world of DVD players. (We use our Xbox Media Center for all DVD playback.) </p>
