excerpt: 'This is certainly one way to garner the attention of an insurance company:
  Register a domain with the name of the company''s Chairman. BobSandler.com is the
  home of "21st Century Claim #286788," where the story of a Jaguar S-Type, practically
  ruined by the penetrating front end of a Hummer H2, is told. Rather than total the
  car as requested, 21st Century chose to repair the vehicle.'

<p>This is certainly one way to garner the attention of an insurance company: <a href="http://www.bobsandler.com/">Register a domain with the name of the company's Chairman</a>. BobSandler.com is the home of "21st Century Claim #286788," where the story of a Jaguar S-Type, practically ruined by the penetrating front end of a Hummer H2, is told. Rather than total the car as requested, 21st Century chose to repair the vehicle.</p>
<p>The claimant of the site seems the sort of person to hold his insurance company to the letter of their contract, racking up $11k in rental car expenses while waiting for resolution. (We call that 'going for the gold.') It seems to be working, however, garnering a fair amount of press and some degree of resolution. According to his last update, he might even get 21st Century to pay for his domain registration and web hosting fees. (<i>Thanks, Brian!</i>)</p>
