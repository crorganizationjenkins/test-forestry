<p>Lockline is cordial enough to deal with, however of the two warranty-covered repairs I have had in the past year and a half in both cases the refurbished handsets were defective. This occurred with both Palm Treo 600 and 650 handsets (of which I currently have the latter).</p>
<p>My current gripe is with the refurb 650 (on replacement #2) that still doesn't work. Aside from the hassle of sending equipment back and being without a phone - Sprint hates to discount their service, when it's beyond your control.</p>
<p>One would think that Sprint would be consumer-centric and work with you to credit lost cell time, when you were unable to use your phone due to faulty hardware. As of today, I have spent a good hour and a half on the phone, and am yet to try and get resolution for the 20 days during which the phone hasn't been working.</p>
<p>They offered me a $15 credit on a base bill of $120 a month (with all services - of which I've only had the ability to text message) </p>
<p>The worst part about all of this is: try calling their business line ( I have a business account: which, gee should get some preferential treatment...) at 888-322-3961. Press 1 for wireless, 1 for sprint and then 1 for English - and you'll be routed to a fax.</p>
