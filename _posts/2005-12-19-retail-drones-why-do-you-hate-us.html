<p>Of course, we kid. 'Drone' implies that you serve as the mindless agent of any intelligence.</p>
<p>Of course, we kid again, because we want something from you. Having spent our tour of duty in retail operations, we know that not every customer is a gem. We'd like to hear your best stories about the endless waves of consumer fodder that has fallen before your infrared barcode guns, and all the stupid things they've said or done before you went on your fifth smoke break of your four-hour shift.</p>
<p>What are the dumbest things customers have ever said to you, retail workers of the world? We'd like to know, via email or comment.</p>
