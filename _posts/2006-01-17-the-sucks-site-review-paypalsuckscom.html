excerpt: If you're going to run a successful Suck Site, you should aim for a big target.
  PayPal Sucks may have stumbled on powerful internet suck alchemy. Anyone who has
  used eBay (the owner of PayPal) more than casually will have run afoul of PayPal
  at least once. And thus, a hit is born.

<p>If you're going to run a successful Suck Site, you should aim for a big target. <a href="http://paypalsucks.com"><i>PayPal Sucks</i></a> may have stumbled on powerful internet suck alchemy. Anyone who has used eBay (the owner of PayPal) more than casually will have run afoul of PayPal at least once. And thus, a hit is born.</p>
<p>The site itself is a horrible mess of links, lacking a predominate logo and scattering links around the main body text like so much chicken feed. There's not even a strong logo on which to center the eye, instead leaving the top-center to a bright yellow ad for "the #1 PayPal Alternative." In fact, much of the site links to other online transaction brokers, something not unreasonable&mdash;in fact, potentially useful!&mdash; but that robs the site of some of its authority. The link in the top navigation bar labeled 'Alternatives' but linking directly to a 'Card Service, Intl.' is by far the most egregious blurring of advocacy and advertisement.</p>
<p><i>PayPal Sucks</i> does have a few smart ideas hidden here and there, such as the section of the forums for "<a href="http://www.paypalsucks.com/forums/showthread.php?fid=3&tid=5637&old_block=0&block=60">Reporters looking for people to interview</a>." Sure, it's massaging the system, but when you're trying to get the press and public to notice your cause, sometimes it's best just to cut the small talk and get down to business.</p>
