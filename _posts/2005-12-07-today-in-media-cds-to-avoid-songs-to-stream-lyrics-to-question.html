excerpt: "â€¢ Confused by the whole 'Sony Rootkit' debacle and don't know which CDs
  might install malicious software that leaves your PC vulnerable to compromise? Sony
  BMG has a list of the 50 CDs with the MediaMax DRM, making it easy for you to avoid
  purchase. You'll just have to get your 'YoungBloodZ' fix elsewhere."

<p>&bull; Confused by the whole 'Sony Rootkit' debacle and don't know which CDs might install malicious software that leaves your PC vulnerable to compromise? Sony BMG has a list of the <a href="http://www.sonybmg.com/mediamax/titles.html">50 CDs with the MediaMax DRM</a>, making it easy for you to avoid purchase. You'll just have to get your 'YoungBloodZ' fix elsewhere.</p>
<p>&bull; Also, EFF's Fred von Lohmann blogs about Real Networks' new web-based Rhapsody music streaming service, which makes <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004232.php">recording of streamed songs trivial</a>. We won't go so far as Fred to call it the "Beginning of the end for music DRM," but being able to record versions of music you've payed for sounds <i>fair usey</i> to us.</p>
<p>&bull; Warner/Chappel sends a cease-and-desist to the developer of <a href="http://www.pearworks.com/pages/pearLyrics.html">pearLyrics</a>, a free tool that scours the internet for lyrics and adds them to the metadata of your MP3s. Because you payed to listen to those sounds, not understand what they mean.</p>
