  point us to what happens when a street artist buffs The Man back, in this case,

<p>Note the buffed graffiti below the altered billboard.</p>
<p>The work is done by a member of Visual Resistance, a Brooklyn-based group of artists who don't like things and make art about 'em, frequently street-based.</p>
