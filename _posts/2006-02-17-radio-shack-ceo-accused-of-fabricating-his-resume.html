<p>The pastor who Radio Shack CEO Dave Edmonson said supervised him while he completed his degree via correspondence courses said he doesn<br />
t recall Edmonson working towards his diploma under his watch, reported the <em>Star-Telegram</em>.</p>
<p>Edmonson claims he spent '77-'78 on campus at Pacific Coast, which the college verifies. But it doesn<br />
t have records that he later took correspondence courses or that he completed his degree.</p>
<p>Through a spokesperson, Mr. Edmonson declined to comment on the matter. The Radio Shack board of directors reaffirmed its decision to stand by Edmonson.</p>
<p>The CEO previously told the paper his diploma burned in a fire in his garage and that the college may have misplaced his records.</p>
<p>Last May, after Radio Shack's CEO took the position, he read a critical column by columnist Mitchell Schnurman. </p>
<p>"I expect you to hold me accountable," Edmonson wrote Schnurman afterwards, "In fact, I treasure the role you will play in my life. My greatest fear is that I will lose myself, somehow forget why I have worked so hard to get to this place and will forget that the character of the leader matters more than anything else."</p>

ve got questions, we<br />
ve got dubious responses.</p>
