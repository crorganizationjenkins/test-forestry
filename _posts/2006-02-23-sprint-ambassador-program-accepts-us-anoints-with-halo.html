<p>We've been accepted into the Sprint Ambassador Program we <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/ambassador-programs/sprint-will-give-us-a-free-cell-phone-for-our-honest-bile-155959.php">told</a> you about. We should be receiving a package in 3-4 business days which includes service, a Samsung A-920<br />
and 6 months of all access to The Sprint Power Vision Network. We are told Sprint enjoy our 'Power Vision experience.' Sounds heady. </p>
<p>Will keep you posted on how it goes. Already, a viscous black liquid is creeping up the side of our leg. We peel it off but it continues at the relentlessly slow pace. </p>
<p>It may be sentient.</p>
