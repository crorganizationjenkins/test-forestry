excerpt: Tom Bartlett writes letters to companies. Not angry, abusive letters full
  of bile and ant eggs, but gentle missives filled with light praise. They're really
  not anything special.

<p>Tom Bartlett writes <a href="http://www.minortweaks.com/archives/consumer_email/index.html">letters to companies</a>. Not angry, abusive letters full of bile and ant eggs, but gentle missives filled with light praise. They're really not anything special.</p>
<p>Which is why the responses sent by the companies Bartlett writes are precious. Some companies obviously respond with a robot who has mastered real, human empathy, while others don't see to quite get the gist at all.</p>
<p>Bartlett writes:<br />
<blockquote>Dear Windex,<br />
I saw your commercial with the talking birds that fly into the window because it's so clean they think it's not really a window. Ha ha! That cracked me up. Stupid birds! It serves them right.</p></blockquote>
<p>Windex responds:<br />
<blockquote>I'm happy to hear the commercial made you laugh. Like many companies, we have a policy for product advertising that states, in part, "Product advertising will inform potential users about our products and their benefits to help them make intelligent, informed buying decisions."</p></blockquote>
