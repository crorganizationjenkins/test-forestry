<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/weapon_detector.jpg"></a>This is the ultimate admission that some flabby walrus from the Bronx inserting a magnetic wand inside your underpants, far from being a Valkyrie in the War on Terror, is accomplishing absolute dick. <a href http:="">Remember, someone who<br />
d be willing to pay 80 dollars to circumvent security couldn<br />
t possibly have a Nike full of plastique.</a><br />
<blockquote>Soon, first class may not just refer to where you sit on an airliner, but how you get on board.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration is considering a plan to allow some frequent fliers to pay a fee and skip the time-consuming  pre-flight security frisking.</p>
<p>The program, called Registered Traveler, would give passengers the option of paying an $80 a year fee and submitting to a background check. If they pass, they would be issued a card that would allow them to walk past the lines of people taking off their shoes and being patted down with an electric wand.</p>
<p>Swell. What<br />
s most enraging about this scheme is that it tries to make money off of the ubiquity of an aggravating social placebo. We all know these pat downs don<br />
t work&mdash;every week, some newspaper sneaks an intrepid reporter into an airport with a gun or a Swiss Army Knife, and with mild ingenuity manages to get them right past the bored minimum-wagers. Like most copyright protection, the only people these security checks thwart are those least likely to be doing anything wrong&MDASH;except the guys doing something wrong here aren<br />
t trying to rip off the latest insufferable Coldplay CD, but slit the pilot<br />
s throat with an exacto knife. But instead of radically rejiggering an impotent system, it<br />
s nice to see someone think to himself,<br />
Hey, as long as the system<br />
s not working, might as well make <em>money</em> off it not working.</p>
