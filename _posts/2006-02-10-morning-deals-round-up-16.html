excerpt: "â€¢ We know that all hard drive manufacturers are probably about the same,
  but we just can't bring outselves to buy the Maxtor 300GB 7,200RPM, 16MB Buffer
  PATA Hard Drive. We've just had too many Maxtor drives bite the dust or wipe out
  our data. But we also suspect we may be under a very specific curse, so don't let
  our hellish experience stop you. Besides, you should be buying two at a time anyway."

<p>&bull; We know that all hard drive manufacturers are probably about the same, but we just can't bring outselves to buy the <a href="http://shop4.outpost.com/product/4187703">Maxtor 300GB 7,200RPM, 16MB Buffer PATA Hard Drive</a>. We've just had too many Maxtor drives bite the dust or wipe out our data. But we also suspect we may be under a very specific curse, so don't let our hellish experience stop you. Besides, you should be buying two at a time anyway.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/548166//102-0392434-9450502">Amazon's Friday Sale</a>, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000AS9CH4/qid=/br=1-23/ref=br_lf_outlet_23//102-0392434-9450502?v=glance&s=outlet&n=548166">RUSHH Energy Drink with Taurine</a> by the case for $30. We're waiting for Limbaughh, the deceptively addictive ham-flavored sports shake.</p>
<p>Stackable coupons, too: <b>CECUSTAPPRCT</b> for 5% in Electronics & Computers; <b>VALENTIN</b> for $25 off $125 in Kitchen & Houswares.</p>
<p>&bull; Electronics retailer <a href="http://www.jr.com/JRSectionView.process?RestartFlow=t&IWAction=Load&Merchant_Id=1&Section_Path=/Promos/Promo02/">J&R</a> has their Friday sale, which would be work going through if we didn't live in NY, where tax applies.</p>
<p>&bull; Buy one two-scoop sundae, <a href="http://www.baskinrobbins.com/IceCream/coupon/EmailCoupon.aspx">get one free</a> at Baskin Robbins. We actually love Baskin Robbins&mdash;leave the folding to proteins, hippies!&mdash;but we don't know if we'll find a store by the 14th.</p>
<p>&bull; DelightDeals calls to our attention a coupon good for<a href="http://www.delightdeals.com/2006/02/25_off_one_book.html">25% off one book</a> at Borders. You'll have to print it out and take it in to the store, so even if you can now afford that Mapplethorpe book you've had your eye on, you can't, unfortunately, order it discreetly online. Expires Sunday.</p>
