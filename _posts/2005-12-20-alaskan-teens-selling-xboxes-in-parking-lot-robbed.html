excerpt: 'We can''t decide which part of this story makes us shiver the most: the
  fact that teenagers were hawking Xbox 360''s in a parking lot or that they were
  doing so in Alaska. Either way it was a dumb decision, since those precious Xboxen
  were stolen right from them at gunpoint.A man who was described as bald and wearing
  bluejeans and a blue hooded sweatshirt walked up to the van, opened its sliding
  door and pulled a gun out, police said. The man ordered the teen to open the van''s
  rear door. Another man, described as having dark curly hair, opened the door and
  took four of the Xboxs.The poor, 14-year-old kid in the car managed to hide a single
  remaining Xbox under his feet. We''re sure when his other four teenage friends returned,
  they graciously let him keep his.'
