<p>&bull; <a href="http://slickdeals.net">SlickDeals</a> has information about <a href="http://slickdeals.net/#p7108">free service for '95 to '97 Hondas</a>, including emissions inspection and new cap, rotor, and wires over 75k miles. Don't let them upsell you the car lock oil, though.</p>
<p>&bull; Amazon hosts Toys R Us's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/14264441/102-0392434-9450502">$5.29 Deals Store</a>. You'll still have to pay for shipping, but there are tons of action figures, games and puzzles, and learning toys to choose from.</p>
<p>&bull; Today's <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a> is a set of nine Tommy Armour Morph Irons (for golf, that is). We once went to a pitch and putt and got really hammered on Natural Ice. That's about our sum total of experience with golf, so you'll have to do your own research on this $165 set.</p>
