<p>Here's all the stuff we couldn't think of enough clever things to say about but nonetheless found interesting.</p>
<ul>
<li>There was some kind of recession from 2001-2004 and people <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060223/ap_on_bi_ge/family_finances">made less money</a>? Whoa, why doesn't anyone tell us these things?!</p>
<p /></li>
<li>Fed vice-chair<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060222/bs_nm/economy_fed_ferguson_dc;_ylt=AmEzka.qDzC.xhQ6cp7XNy2yBhIF;_ylu=X3oDMTA5aHJvMDdwBHNlYwN5bmNhdA--"> pulled out</a>. Inflation would take a pratfall when trying to sit down... but everyone just salutes what the chairman says anyway. Learning of this, political cartoonists, sigh and crumple scribbles containing a splintery chair labeled "Ferguson," an anthropomorphic balloon labeled "Inflation," a man smiling (or in some cartoonist's cases, spinning) inside his coffin labeled "Greenspan" and an oblivious "George Bush" labeled burning bush snorting cocaine off an upside-down book spine.
<p /></li>
<li><a href="http://www.singleservecoffee.com/archives/004855.php">Save 10%</a> on Single Serve Coffee Makers. Can you stack multiple coffee pods into one brewing? Otherwise, we're not buying.
<p /></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/23/business/media/23adco.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">Sniggling advocacy group</a> tries to hamstring Craigslist, claiming bias in housing ads, instead of dealing with the real issue: motherboards are bigoted.

No one say iPod killer. Nobody. Stop it.</p>

<li>MoveOn.org, having nothing better to do and feeling sympathetic towards spammers, <a href="http://www.civic.moveon.org/emailtax/">petitions</a> against AOL email tax.</li>
