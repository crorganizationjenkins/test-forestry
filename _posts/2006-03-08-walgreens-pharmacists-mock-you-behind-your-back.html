<p>How would you like to see this on your bottle of meds?</p>
<p>"<em>CrAzY!! She's really a psycho!!! Do not say her name too loud, never mention her meds by names...</em>" </p>
<p>Janey Karp sued Walgreens over the above comments appearing on a patient information sheet attached to her latest bottle of Ambien.</p>
<p>"A person has the right to have whatever medications they're taking to be private," she said. "I'm so private that I never talk about my medications and now they're telling me that I'm psycho, crazy."</p>
<p>Walgreens apologized profusely and is actively investigating. The notes were first entered in September, 2004. Walgreens' new prescrption computer system links all 5,122 stores into a one network. Who knows how many have seen and read the deragatory comments...</p>
<p>Or how many other shoppers have slanderous remarks listed on their patient profile.</p>
