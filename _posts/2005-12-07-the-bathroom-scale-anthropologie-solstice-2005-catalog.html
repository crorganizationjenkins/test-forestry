<p><b>The Catalog</b>: Anthropologie Solstice 2005. 'Solstice' is Catalog for 'fancy.' Also online <a href="http://www.anthropologie.com/shopping/s7catalog/s7main.jsp?catname=solstice_05_d2">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>The Target</b>: Women who want their oaken headboards distressed, but their table lamps bouncing soft light off minimalist gauchos to be tear-dropped and unblemished.</p>
<p><b>The Models</b>: Three-fifths, by weight, of the girls we knew next door. In <i>Elf City</i>. The redhead, relegated to the back of the book, is stunning.</p>
<p><b>Bathroom Reading Rating:</b> The layout is unassumingly composited; the photography is interesting; the paper is soft, with a chalky cover that lends itself to languid browsing (or emergency shortages). Suitable for women and guys who would like to impress them, without being totally gay.</p>
<p><i>Four swallowtail floor cushions out of five. A keeper.</i></p>
