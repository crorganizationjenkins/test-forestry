On March 9th, Amsterdam<br />
s cobbled streets will be filled with the clatter of stilettos as women run seventy-five meters to vie for the prize of<br />
 10,000 or 11,877.01 in U.S. torture dollars. The race is masterminded by glossy mysoginists, Glamour Magazine.</p>
<p>In a disappointment to the hedonistic town<br />
s illiterate trannies, the press release reports<br />
only woman are allowed to run and stiletto's as well as a copy of the March fashion issue are a must to compete.</p>
<p>Furthermore,<br />
the run will have a guerrilla character.<br />
 You know how big the Zapatistas are on pop fashion.</p>
<p>If you<br />
re over there loading up on absinthe for your company<br />
s annual ides of March celebration, go <a href="http://www.glamour.nl">here</a> to apply to race.</p>
<p>Just watch those ankles.</p>
