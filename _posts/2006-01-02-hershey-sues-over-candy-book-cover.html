excerpt: 'Simon & Schuster have settled an injunction against them made by the Hershey
  Company over inappropriate use of the Hershey trademark for the book cover of Hershey
  : Milton S. Hershey''s Extraordinary Life of Wealth, Empire, and Utopian Dreams,
  "the story of ''a gambler, raconteur, despot and servant''." The settlement will
  allow Simon & Schuster to keep the strikingly attractive cover to the left as long
  as Simon & Schuster slap an "Unauthorized" sticker on every cover.'

<p><a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/images/hershey.jpg"></a>Simon & Schuster have settled an injunction against them made by the Hershey Company over inappropriate use of the Hershey trademark for the book cover of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743264096/qid=1136191966/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-5566900-2827252?n=507846&s=books&v=glance">Hershey : Milton S. Hershey's Extraordinary Life of Wealth, Empire, and Utopian Dreams</a>, "the story of 'a gambler, raconteur, despot and servant'." The settlement will allow Simon & Schuster to keep the strikingly attractive cover to the left as long as Simon & Schuster slap an "Unauthorized" sticker on every cover.</p>
<p>We're really concerned with this story because of an adorably snarky quote from the book's author:</p>
<blockquote><p>Author Michael D'Antonio called the settlement "a victory for people who can't tell the difference between recycled paper and chocolate"...</p></blockquote>
<p>A man well after the inflatable black bladders of bile throbbing cold and deep within our own chests!</p>
