<p>Sprint just approached us to be "Ambassadors." Basically, Sprint gives us a free Power Vision Phone and service for six months in return for our "candid feedback." </p>
<p>The only thing is that Sprint Ambassador Team wanted us to be on the "Team" after visiting our blog; they are targeting us because we are bloggers. They say all they want back is our opinion, but we know they're hoping to get a little linky and bloggy love too. </p>
<p>Other products that targeted bloggers include <a href="http://www.freshglue.com/fresh_glue/2006/01/um_thats_ambass.html">Maker's Mark</a>, <a href="http://www.stormhoek.com/">Stormhoek Wine</a> and Joseph Jaffe giving away a free copy of his book, "<a href="http://www.lifeafter30.com/">Life After the 30-second spot</a>" to any blogger who will post about it after reading.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should we accept and put the "ass" back in Ambassador? Or refuse and avoid getting coated by the gunk inside Sprint's pocket? </p>
<p>Also, if we join, we'll have to walk around with a big yellow box around our head, like the fellow pictured. As well as endure, from what we've heard, substandard service.</p>
<p>It just so happens that our Verizon cell phone is totally busted and when we turn our pockets out these little moths flutter outwards and upwards.</p>
<p>It's very important we maintain our aura of dubious authority.</p>
