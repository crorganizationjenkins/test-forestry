excerpt: Sony's searching for interns to push its artists online.

<p>Sony's searching for interns to push its artists online.</p>
<p>"Do you blog, have lots of firends at your MySpace page, and love music?" asked the ad at entertainmentcareers.net. </p>
<p>Epic Records, a subsidiary of Sony BMG, "is looking for skilled, motivated interns to promote artists on social networking sites like MySpace, Purevolume, Facebook and others."</p>
<p>The ad has since been pulled after getting sniped by "What's Online" in the New York Times  on Feb. 18th, 2005, but we've got it <a href="http://64.233.179.104/search?q=cache:lPQG4IsP6nwJ:www.entertainmentcareers.net/index.asp+site:www.entertainmentcareers.net+%22do+you+blog%22&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=1">here</a>, thanks to the magic of Google cache.</p>
<p>In return for selling out and buying in, you get college credit and a tick point for your resume, which should be very useful should you be seeking a job in the future requiring little to no integrity, like marketing. Perhaps we should send this posting to our winner of today's <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/barters/today-in-craigslist-barter-nyc-it-aint-just-cheese-for-plowshares-anymore-156105.php">most pathetic barter</a>?</p>
