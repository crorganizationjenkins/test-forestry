excerpt: 'Seth Godin proposes customers get a reward for using the phone to call companies,
  as an incentive to leave their information and get a callback:"Hi, you''ve reached
  us when we''re too busy. Quick, write down this code: 123x23. Now, give us your
  phone number. When we call back (within an hour, we promise), give us the code and
  we''ll pay you $20 on the spot for the hassle in getting this order processed."Call
  center justice is one of our most petted peeves, so for us this idea resonates.
  Sadly, since most customer interaction is measured on a per-transaction basis by
  the management, we doubt they would be willing to fork over any rewards of substance
  just so they can sell to you.'
