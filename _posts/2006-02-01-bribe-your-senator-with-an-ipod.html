excerpt: Upon being purchased an iPod by his daughter, Alaskan / octogenarian Senator
  Ted Stevens suddenly came around on the concept of fair use. So taking their cue
  from Senator Stevens' conversion, iPaction.org has started a campaign to buy every
  senator who has a say in legislation affecting technology a brand new video iPod.
  The theory is that a brand-new iPod loaded with "public domain content, Creative
  Commons content, and audio messages about the importance of balanced copyright policy"
  is going to sway our lawmakers into a more lenient view of consumers' media rights
  than the RIAA-propaganda they are currently being lobby-fed.

<p>We love it. Those crappy Creative Commons mp3s are going to be formatted off those iPods in a second &mdash; who in god's names would willingly listen to that crap, anyway? &mdash; but <em>finally</em>, a campaign that acknowledges that the best way to change lawmakers minds is through open bribery. Would <em>you</em> like to help flagrantly bribe a senator into protecting the rights of consumers? <a href="http://www.ipaction.org/campaigns/ipod/">Go donate to iPaction.org's campaign today. </a></p>
