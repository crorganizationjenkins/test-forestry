<p>We<br />
ve got the skinny on<br />
Pherotones<br />
 and unfortunately, it<br />
s not that there really are ring tones that made people hanker to park their cellphone in your charger cradle. You may have seen the campaign wheat pasted all over our struggling, chaste, sister blog Gawker and on several high-draw blogs in the past weeks.

 Fake BoingBoing interviews and declarations of Proof Found! complete with video followed, carefully throttled out by, as the adbloggers quickly gleaned, ad agency McKinney Silver in a viral marketing effort for an undisclosed client.</p>
<p>Today, Adrants announced some HTML snooping unearthed that Oasys, a provider of hot babe wallpapers, top40 ringtones and the like for mobiles, was the secret client.</p>
<p>Mystery solved, though it's suspicious the info, originally posted in late January, only bubbled up today. February 14th was strongly positioned this year as a great day to get a new cellphone for your valentine.</p>
