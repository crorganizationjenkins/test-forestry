excerpt: 'If we were the gnarlled toothed ogres who work at NatWest bank, we would
  call removing all clocks from the public waiting areas a ''customer hack.'' Rather
  than work to shorten the lines of customers at NatWest, bank managers have chosen
  to instead remove all timepieces from the walls.One worker said: "If people have
  been standing waiting to see a cashier for a long time they can get very cross.'

<blockquote>One worker said: "If people have been standing waiting to see a cashier for a long time they can get very cross.</p></blockquote>
<p>"With a clock there, it was difficult for us to disagree with them. Without one it's harder for them to complain."</p>
