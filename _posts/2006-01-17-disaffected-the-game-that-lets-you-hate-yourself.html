<p>It's not often we get to link to videogames, but we're happy to direct your attention to 'Disaffected,' a sort of inverse to the advergame&mdash;games that shill products as their primary or secondary purpose&mdash;where players experience what it's like to be a Kinko's-like employee. </p>
<p>For we consumers, think of it as an opportunity to empathize with those behind the counter. Or if you're really looking for a moment of workplace therapy, turn <i>Disaffected</i> on and leave it running unattended while you take a coffee/tea/cigarette/barbiturate break, thereby doubling the amount of responsibility you are shirking (which always makes those breaks that much more delicious).</p>
